### Sahih Muslim 6384
Abu Huraira reported that 'Umar happened to pass by Hassan as he was reciting verses in the mosque. He (Hadrat 'Umar) looked towards him (meaningfully), whereupon he (gassin) said:I used to recite (verses) when one better than you (the Holy Prophet) had been present (here). He then looked towards Abu Huraira and said to him: I adjure you by Allah (to tell) if you had not heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: (Hassan), give a reply on my behalf; Allah I help him with Ruh-ul-Qudus. He (Abu Huraira) said: By Allah, it is so (i. e. the Prophet actually said these words)

### Sahih Bukhari 5
Narrated Said bin Jubair: Ibn 'Abbas in the explanation of the statement of Allah "Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith." (75.16) said "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to bear the revelation with great trouble and used to move his lips (quickly) with the Inspiration." Ibn 'Abbas moved his lips saying, "I am moving my lips in front of you as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to move his." Said moved his lips saying: "I am moving my lips, as I saw Ibn 'Abbas moving his." Ibn 'Abbas added, "So Allah revealed 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur'an) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Quran)' (75.16-17) which means that Allah will make him (the Prophet) remember the portion of the Qur'an which was revealed at that time by heart and recite it. The statement of Allah: 'And when we have recited it to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then you follow its (Quran) recital' (75.18) means 'listen to it and be silent.' Then it is for Us (Allah) to make it clear to you' (75.19) means 'Then it is (for Allah) to make you recite it (and its meaning will be clear by itself through your tongue). Afterwards, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to listen to Gabriel whenever he came and after his departure he used to recite it as Gabriel had recited it

The Shahada must be recited with correct pronunciation and understanding — it is not merely a phrase to repeat, but a binding testimony before Allah. Mispronunciation can alter the meaning, and recitation without comprehension reduces the most powerful statement in Islam to empty words.


**How?**

**1. Phonetic Breakdown & Pronunciation**

The Shahada is split into two testimonies. Focus on the flow and the emphasis on the double consonants (marked with double letters).

**Part 1: The Testimony of Faith**

*Ash-hadu alla ilaha illAllah*

* **Ash-hadu**: (Ash-ha-du) — I bear witness
* **Alla**: (Al-la) — That [there is] no
* **Ilaha**: (I-la-ha) — Deity/God
* **IllAllah**: (Il-lal-lah) — Except Allah

**Part 2: The Testimony of Messengerhood**

*Wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasoolullah*

* **Wa**: (Wa) — And
* **Anna**: (An-na) — That
* **Muhammadan**: (Mu-ham-ma-dan) — Muhammad
* **Rasoolullah**: (Ra-soo-lul-lah) — is the Messenger of Allah

---

**2. Precise Word-for-Word Translation**

Linguistically, the Shahada isn't just a statement of existence; it is a statement of **exclusive right**.

| Arabic Word | Precise English Meaning | Linguistic Role |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ash-hadu** | I bear witness | A formal, binding testimony. |
| **An (La)** | That (No) | Absolute negation of a category. |
| **Ilah** | Object of Worship | Anything served, loved, or obeyed. |
| **Illa** | Except | The turning point from negation to affirmation. |
| **Allah** | The One True God | The only one with the *right* to be worshipped. |
| **Rasool** | Messenger | One who carries a divine message/law. |

**3. Practical Tips for "Understanding"**

1. **The Pause:** When you say *"La ilaha,"* mentally "clear" your heart of dependencies on wealth, ego, or people.
2. **The Affirmation:** When you say *"illAllah,"* settle the heart on the fact that only He provides, sustains, and deserves your ultimate devotion.
3. **The Follow-through:** Acknowledging Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the *Rasool* means accepting his sunnah as the practical map for your life.` },

Narrated \`Abdullah bin \`Amr:Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was informed that I had taken an oath to fast daily and to pray (every night) all the night throughout my life (so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me and asked whether it was correct): I replied, "Let my parents be sacrificed for you! I said so." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "You can not do that. So, fast for few days and give it up for few days, offer Salat (prayer) and sleep. Fast three days a month as the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times and that will be equal to one year of fasting." I replied, "I can do better than that." The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, "Fast one day and give up fasting for two days." I replied, "I can do better than that." The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, "Fast one day and give up fasting for a day and that is the fasting of Prophet David and that is the best fasting." I said, "I have the power to fast better (more) than that." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "There is no better fasting than that

La ilaha illAllah is not a passive statement — it is an active negation of every false object of worship and an affirmation that Allah alone deserves your ultimate devotion. This has direct consequences for where you place your hopes, fears, and reliance.


**How?**

1. List three things you tend to rely on most (e.g., salary, reputation, a specific person). For each, ask: "Am I treating this as though it has independent power over my life?"
2. Reflect on your fears — do you fear anyone's displeasure more than Allah's?
3. Journal about how "no god but Allah" reframes one specific decision you are currently facing.
4. You have completed this when you can articulate how Tawhid reshapes at least one priority, one fear, and one hope in your daily life.` },

The Shahada is not merely words on the tongue — it must settle in the heart and manifest in action. The munafiqun declared it verbally but lacked inner conviction, and the Quran exposed the emptiness of their claim.

1. Read Surah al-Munafiqun (63:1-3) and note how Allah describes their outward declaration versus their inward state.
2. Study the difference between *iqrar bil-lisan* (verbal affirmation), *tasdiq bil-qalb* (heart conviction), and *amal bil-arkan* (action with the limbs).

The Shahada is not abstract theology — it is the core of your identity as a Muslim. Journaling forces you to move beyond rote understanding and confront where your conviction is genuinely strong and where it needs honest growth.


**How?**

1. Set aside 20 minutes in a quiet space. Begin with bismillah and a brief du'a for clarity.
2. Write freely in response to these prompts:
   - "What does it mean to me personally that there is no god but Allah?"
   - "Where in my life do I feel most aligned with this testimony? Where do I feel the gap?"
   - "If I truly lived this declaration, what would change tomorrow?"
3. Be honest — this is between you and Allah, not for anyone else.
4. You have completed this when you have at least one page of genuine reflection that identifies both a strength and a growth area in your conviction.` },

Understanding the grammar prevents common misconceptions. For example:

* It doesn't just mean "God exists" (which even the pagans of Mecca believed).
* It doesn't just mean "God is the Creator" (which is *Tawhid ar-Rububiyyah*).
* **It specifically means** that nothing has the *right* to be worshipped, sought for ultimate help, or obeyed unconditionally except Allah.


**How?**

**1. The Component Breakdown**

Linguistically, the phrase is composed of four parts that create a "restrictive negation."

* **La (لا):** Known as the *La al-Nafiyah lil-Jins* (The "No" of absolute categorical negation). It denies the existence of the entire category that follows it.
* **Ilah (إله):** A noun derived from the root *alaha*, meaning "to worship." Linguistically, an *ilah* is anything that is taken as an object of ultimate love, reverence, and obedience.
* **Illa (إلا):** A particle of exception ("except").
* **Allah (الله):** The proper name of the Creator.

---

**2. The Two Pillars: Negation & Affirmation**

To study the meaning linguistically is to understand that the sentence cannot function without two distinct actions:

| Pillar | Arabic Term | Meaning |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Negation** | *Al-Nafy* | **"La ilaha"** – You are clearing the heart of all false gods, idols, and internal desires that act as masters. |
| **Affirmation** | *Al-Ithbat* | **"illAllah"** – You are affirming that the right to be worshipped belongs exclusively to Allah. |

**Note:** Scholarly analysis emphasizes that the hidden predicate (*khabar*) in the sentence is **bi-haqqin** (in truth). Thus, the full linguistic meaning is: *"There is no deity worthy of worship **in truth** except Allah."*` },

### Sahih Bukhari 6681

*(Grade: Sahih)*`,
          description: `**Why?**

The negation rejects all false deities, superstitions, and objects of ultimate devotion. The affirmation establishes that worship, obedience, love, and fear belong to Allah alone. Without understanding this "clearing and establishing" process, one's testimony remains superficial and fails to protect the heart from subtle forms of shirk.

**How?**

To successfully complete this subtask, you must move beyond a simple translation and internalize the two-pillar mechanism of the Shahada:

1. **The Pillar of Negation (*An-Nafy*):**
   * **Action:** Mentally "clear the shelf."
   * **Focus:** Identify anything that currently competes for your ultimate devotion—be it wealth, ego, social status, or superstitious beliefs.
   * **Grammar:** Understand that the "La" used here is *La al-Nafiyah lil-Jins* (Absolute Negation). It doesn't just say "no God exists," it says "there is no such thing as a deity" that has any right to be worshipped.
2. **The Pillar of Affirmation (*Al-Ithbat*):**
   * **Action:** Re-establish the Creator as the sole authority.
   * **Focus:** Once the "shelf" is clear, affirm that only Allah occupies that space. This means all acts of the heart—unconditional love, total reliance (*Tawakkul*), and absolute fear—are directed toward Him alone.
3. **The Synthesis:**
   * **Practice:** Recite the phrase while pausing slightly after "La ilaha" to symbolize the rejection, then firmly stating "illAllah" to symbolize the commitment.
   * **Verification:** You have completed this task when you can explain why "There is no God but Allah" is a less accurate translation than "There is no deity **rightfully** worshipped except Allah."` },

**Arabic:** وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا  
**Translation:** Worship God; join nothing with Him.`,
          description: `**Why?**

Worship (*ibadah*) encompasses prayer, du'a, sacrifice, vows, reliance, hope, and fear. None of these may be directed to anything other than Allah. Directing even a single act of worship to another—whether it be a person, an idol, or one's own ego—invalidates the essence of the Shahada and constitutes *Shirk* (associating partners with Allah).

**How?**

To complete this subtask, expand your definition of worship from physical rituals to the actions of the heart and tongue:

1. **Categorize Acts of Worship:**
   * **Physical (*Badaniyah*):** Ensure your prostration (*sujud*), sacrifice (*udhiya*), and circumambulation are for Allah alone.
   * **Verbal (*Qawliyah*):** Recognize that calling upon the deceased or hidden forces for help (*Istigatha*) is a form of worship that belongs only to the Creator.
   * **Internal (*Qalbiyah*):** Audit your "inner compass." Ask yourself: "Do I fear a created being's displeasure more than Allah's?" or "Do I rely on my bank account more than I rely on the Provider?"
2. **Identify "Subtle" Partners:**
   * Reflect on the concept of *Hawa* (desires). Study how following one's whims blindly can become a form of "taking one's desire as a god" (Quran 45:23).
   * Learn the difference between "natural fear" (e.g., fear of a predator) and "secret fear" (fearing that a created being can harm or benefit you independently of Allah's will).
3. **The Test of Sincerity:**
   * You have completed this task when you can list five distinct acts of worship—both internal and external—and verify that they are directed solely to Allah in your daily life.` },

Surah al-Ikhlas (112) defines Allah's oneness and absolute independence, serving as the "litmus test" for monotheism. Ayat al-Kursi (2:255) describes His sovereignty, living nature, and total control over the universe. Reading these with tafsir allows you to move from mere recitation to a deep intellectual and spiritual absorption of His attributes.

**How?**

1. **Analyze Surah al-Ikhlas (The Sincerity/Purity):**
   * **The Concept of *As-Samad*:** Look up the definition of this name in verse 2. Understand it as the One who is "Self-Sufficient" and whom all of creation depends upon, while He depends on no one.
   * **Negating Lineage:** Reflect on verse 3 (*"He neither begets nor is born"*). Understand how this specifically refutes any claims of God having children or parents.
2. **Deconstruct Ayat al-Kursi (The Verse of the Throne):**
   * **Attribute of *Al-Hayy* & *Al-Qayyum*:** Study how these two names establish Allah as Ever-Living and the Sustainer of all existence.
   * **The *Kursi* (Throne):** Visualize the scale of His sovereignty as described in the text — that His throne extends over the heavens and the earth, yet guarding them does not tire Him.
3. **Cross-Reference with Tafsir:**
   * Use a reliable source (like Ibn Kathir or Ma'ariful Quran) to read the background (*Sabab al-Nuzul*) of Surah al-Ikhlas.
   * **Verification:** You have completed this task when you can explain the meaning of "As-Samad" and list three attributes of Allah mentioned in Ayat al-Kursi that demonstrate His absolute power over the universe.` },

2. Identify any doubts or uncertainties you carry — about Allah's existence, His wisdom, or His decree. Write them down honestly.

Acceptance means embracing everything the Shahada requires — every ruling, obligation, and prohibition that comes from Allah and His Messenger. Rejecting any part of what Allah legislated while claiming to accept the Shahada is a contradiction that undermines the testimony itself.

2. For each area of resistance, study the wisdom behind the ruling from reliable scholarly sources.

Knowledge and acceptance must lead to action. Submission (*inqiyad*) is the bridge between knowing the truth and living it. The Shahada demands that you submit to Allah's commands in practice — pray, give zakah, fast, and follow the Sunnah. Without action, the testimony is incomplete.


**How?**

1. Audit your daily practice: are the five pillars established in your life (prayer, zakah, fasting, Hajj if able)?
2. Identify one area where you know what is required but have not yet submitted in action.
3. Create a concrete plan to begin acting on that obligation — start small but start now.

The Shahada must be said truthfully from the heart, not merely with the tongue. The opposite is the state of the munafiqun (hypocrites) who declared faith outwardly but disbelieved inwardly. Allah exposed their condition throughout Surah al-Munafiqun — their words did not match their hearts.


**How?**

1. Read Surah al-Munafiqun (63:1-4) and reflect on the disconnect between outward profession and inner reality.
2. Ask yourself honestly: "When I say the Shahada, does my heart affirm what my tongue declares?"
3. Identify any areas where you perform Islam outwardly but feel emptiness or contradiction inwardly.
4. You have completed this when you have made a sincere self-assessment and begun addressing any gap between your outward declaration and inner state — even if the journey is ongoing.` },

### Sahih Bukhari 3
Narrated 'Aisha (the mother of the faithful believers):The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright daylight, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food likewise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "I do not know how to read." The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous." (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, "Cover me! Cover me!" They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, "I fear that something may happen to me." Khadija replied, "Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones." Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, "Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!" Waraqa asked, "O my nephew! What have you seen?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, "This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, "Will they drive me out?" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, "Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly." But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while

Narrated Abu Huraira: One day while the Prophet (ﷺ) was sitting in the company of some people, (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, "What is faith?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, 'Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection." Then he further asked, "What is Islam?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "To worship Allah Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan." Then he further asked, "What is Ihsan (perfection)?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you." Then he further asked, "When will the Hour be established?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "The answerer has no better knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its portents. 1. When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master. 2. When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Allah. The Prophet (ﷺ) then recited: "Verily, with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour--." (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet (ﷺ) asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion." Abu 'Abdullah said: He (the Prophet) considered all that as a part of faith

The Shahada must be for Allah's sake alone, not for worldly gain, social acceptance, or any motive other than devotion to Him. Sincerity (*ikhlas*) is what gives the testimony its weight before Allah — without it, even outwardly correct worship is hollow.


**How?**

1. Study Surah al-Bayyinah (98:5): "They were not commanded except to worship Allah, sincere to Him in religion."
2. Examine your motives: do you practice Islam to please people, maintain a social image, or out of cultural habit?
3. Learn the du'a for protection from riya (showing off): "Allahumma inni a'udhu bika an ushrika bika shay'an a'lamuhu, wa astaghfiruka lima la a'lamu."
4. You have completed this when you can honestly assess your primary motivation for declaring the Shahada and have taken steps to purify your intention for Allah alone.` },

Love for Allah and His Messenger must surpass love for all else. Allah says in Quran 2:165: "Those who believe are stronger in their love for Allah." This love is not mere sentiment — it drives obedience, sacrifice, and prioritization of what pleases Allah over what pleases the self or others.


**How?**

1. Read Quran 2:165 and 9:24 with tafsir. Note what Allah lists as competing loves (wealth, family, trade) and how faith must surpass them all.
2. Study the hadith: "None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his father, his child, and all of mankind" (Bukhari 15).
3. Reflect: in a moment of conflict between what you desire and what Allah commands, which wins? Identify a recent example.

Narrated 'Ubada bin As-Samit:"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out to inform the people about the (date of the) night of decree (Al-Qadr) but there happened a quarrel between two Muslim men. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "I came out to inform you about (the date of) the night of Al-Qadr, but as so and so and so and so quarrelled, its knowledge was taken away (I forgot it) and maybe it was better for you.

### Sahih Muslim 99
It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Ask me (about religious matters), but they (the Companions) were in awe of asking him. Then came a man, and sat near his knees and said: O Messenger of Allah, what is al-Islam? So he (the Holy Prophet) replied: [That] you do not associate anything with Allah, and establish the prayer, pay the alms (Zakat) and fast Ramadan. He said: You (have) told the truth. He said: Messenger of Allah, what is al-Iman (Faith)? He said: That you affirm your faith in Allah, His angels, His Books, His meeting, His Apostles, and that you believe in Resurrection and that you believe in Qadr (Divine Decree) in all its entirety. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He said: Messenger of Allah, what is al-Ihsan? Upon this he said: that you fear Allah as if you are seeing Him, and though you see Him not, verily He is seeing you. He (the inquirer) said: You (have) told the truth. He (the inquirer) said: When will the Hour (of Doom) occur? He said: The one who is being asked about it is no better informed than the inquirer and I will narrate some of its signs to you. When you see a [slave] woman giving birth to her master - then that is [one] of its signs. And when you see barefooted, naked, deaf and dumb (ignorant and foolish persons) as the rulers of the earth - then that is [one] of its signs. And when you see the shepherds of black (camels) exult in buildings - then that is [one] of its signs. The (Hour) is one of the five things of the unseen. No one knows them except Allah. Then (the Holy Prophet) recited (the folowing verse):" Verily Allah! with Him alone is the knowledge of the Hour and He it is Who sends down the rain and knows that which is in the wombs. And no soul knows what it shall earn on the morrow and a soul knows not in what land it shall die. Verily Allah is Knowing, Aware." He (Abu Huraira) said: Then the person stood up (and made his way). Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Bring him back to me. He was searched for, but they could not find him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) thereupon said: He was Gabriel and he wanted to teach you when you did not ask

Belief in divine decree (*qadar*) means affirming that Allah's knowledge encompasses everything, He wrote it all in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz, He wills everything that happens, and He creates all things. Good and bad are both from His decree. This belief is the anchor of patience in hardship and gratitude in ease.


**How?**

1. Study the four levels of qadar: Allah's knowledge, His writing, His will, and His creation of all things.
2. Read the hadith of Jibril's question about Iman and note that belief in qadar is the sixth and final article.
3. Reflect on a personal hardship: can you see it through the lens of qadar — that it was known, written, willed, and created by Allah for a wisdom you may not yet understand?
4. You have completed this when you can explain the four levels of qadar and describe how this belief should influence your response to both blessings and trials.` },

Superstitious beliefs — like "bad luck" from broken mirrors, black cats, or certain numbers — contradict reliance on Allah's decree alone. They attribute power or influence to created things that have no ability to benefit or harm, and this undermines the foundation of Tawhid.

1. Write down any superstitions you were raised with or currently hold, even ones that seem harmless.
2. For each one, ask: "Does this belief attribute power to something other than Allah?"
3. Study the hadith: "There is no tiyarah (superstitious belief in bird omens)" (Bukhari 5776) and understand the broader principle.

The Prophet (SAW) said: "Whoever wears an amulet has committed shirk."

Wearing items believed to bring protection or luck — such as evil eye bracelets, strings, or stones — can constitute minor or major shirk depending on the belief attached. If you believe the object itself has power, this is major shirk. If you believe it is merely a "cause," it is still prohibited as minor shirk.


**How?**

1. Physically check: are you wearing or keeping any items you believe bring protection or luck?
2. Study the hadith: "Whoever wears an amulet has committed shirk" (Ahmad 17440).
3. Replace any reliance on objects with the prescribed Quranic and prophetic protections: the morning/evening adhkar, Ayat al-Kursi, and the three Quls.
4. You have completed this when you have removed any such items and replaced them with authentic means of seeking Allah's protection.` },

The Prophet (SAW) said: "Whoever swears by other than Allah has committed shirk" (Ahmad, Tirmidhi). Swearing by something elevates it to a position of reverence that belongs to Allah alone. Many people habitually swear by their life, parents, or honour without realising the gravity of this act.


**How?**

1. Monitor your speech for one week: note every time you swear by something other than Allah (e.g., "I swear on my mother's life").
2. Each time you catch yourself, immediately correct it by saying "wallahi" or rephrasing.
3. Study the hadith in full context (Ahmad, Tirmidhi) and understand why oaths are reserved for Allah alone.
4. You have completed this when you have consciously replaced the habit and can go a full week without swearing by other than Allah.` },

Identifying contradictions to Tawhid is only the first step — removing them is what completes the process. Each uncorrected practice is a crack in the foundation of your testimony. Taking practical steps to remove these contradictions is an act of worship in itself.


**How?**

1. Review the list of contradictions you identified in the previous subtasks.
2. For each item, take a concrete corrective action: physically remove amulets, verbally commit to stopping superstitious practices, and consciously correct your oaths.
3. Replace each removed practice with a sunnah alternative (e.g., replace an amulet with morning adhkar; replace superstitious avoidance with tawakkul).
4. You have completed this when every identified contradiction has been addressed with a specific action and you have renewed your reliance on Allah alone.` },

### Sahih Bukhari 5191
Narrated Ibn \`Abbas:I had been eager to ask \`Umar bin Al-Khattab about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said 'If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah, your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes). (66.4) till \`Umar performed the Hajj and I too, performed the Hajj along with him. (On the way) \`Umar went aside to answer the call of nature, and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler full of water, and when \`Umar had finished answering the call of nature, I poured water over his hands and he performed the ablution. Then I said to him, "O chief of the Believers! Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) regarding whom Allah said: 'If you two (wives of the Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)?" (66.4) He said, "I am astonished at your question, O Ibn \`Abbas. They were \`Aisha and Hafsa." Then \`Umar went on narrating the Hadith and said, "I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid who used to live in \`Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet (ﷺ) in turn. He used to go one day and I another day. When I went, I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but when we came to the Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand over their men, so our women also started learning the ways of the Ansari women. I shouted at my wife and she retorted against me and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said to me, 'Why are you so surprised at my answering you back? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet answer him back and some of them may leave (does not speak to) him throughout the day till the night.' The (talk) scared me and I said to her, 'Whoever has done so will be ruined!' Then I proceeded after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to her, 'Does anyone of you keep the Prophet (ﷺ) angry till night?' She said, 'Yes.' I said, 'You are a ruined losing person! Don't you fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and thus you will be ruined? So do not ask more from the Prophet (ﷺ) and do not answer him back and do not give up talking to him. Ask me whatever you need and do not be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e., \`Aisha) in her manners for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet (ﷺ) ." \`Umar added,"At that time a talk was circulating among us that (the tribe of) Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. My Ansari companion, on the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently and asked if I was there. I became horrified and came out to him. He said, 'Today a great thing has happened.' I asked, 'What is it? Have (the people of) Ghassan come?' He said, 'No, but (What has happened) is greater and more horrifying than that: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ); has divorced his wives. \`Umar added, "The Prophet (ﷺ) kept away from his wives and I said "Hafsa is a ruined loser.' I had already thought that most probably this (divorce) would happen in the near future. So I dressed myself and offered the morning prayer with the Prophet (ﷺ) and then the Prophet; entered an upper room and stayed there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked, 'What makes you weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the Prophet (ﷺ) divorce you all?' She said, 'I do not know. There he is retired alone in the upper room.' I came out and sat near the pulpit and saw a group of people sitting around it and some of them were weeping. I sat with them for a while but could not endure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet; was and said to a black slave of his, 'Will you get the permission (of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) for \`Umar (to enter)?' The slave went in, talked to the Prophet (ﷺ) about it and then returned saying, 'I have spoken to the Prophet (ﷺ) and mentioned you but he kept quiet.' Then I returned and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not bear the situation and once again I said to the slave, 'Will you get the permission for \`Umar?' He went in and returned saying, 'I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.' So I returned again and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, and so I went to the slave and said, 'Will you get the permission for \`Umar?' He went in and returned to me saying, 'I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.' When I was leaving, behold! The slave called me, saying, 'The Prophet (ﷺ) has given you permission.' Then I entered upon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and saw him Lying on a bed made of stalks of date palm leaves and there was no bedding between it and him. The stalks left marks on his side and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with date-palm fibres. I greeted him and while still standing I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Have you divorced your wives?' He looked at me and said, 'No.' I said, 'Allah Akbar!' And then, while still standing, I said chatting, 'Will you heed what I say, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? We, the people of Quraish used to have power over our women, but when we arrived at Medina we found that the men (here) were overpowered by their women.' The Prophet (ﷺ) smiled and then I said to him, 'Will you heed what I say, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? I entered upon Hafsa and said to her, "Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (\`Aisha), for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet.' " The Prophet (ﷺ) smiled for a second time. When I saw him smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by Allah, I could not see anything of importance in his house except three hides, so I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Invoke Allah to make your followers rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made prosperous and they have been given (the pleasures of the world), although they do not worship Allah.' Thereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) sat up as he was reclining. and said, 'Are you of such an opinion, O the son of Al-Khattab? These are the people who have received the rewards for their good deeds in this world.' I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Ask Allah to forgive me.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) kept away from his wives for twenty-nine days because of the story which Hafsa had disclosed to \`Aisha. The Prophet (ﷺ) had said, 'I will not enter upon them (my wives) for one month,' because of his anger towards them, when Allah had admonished him. So, when twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet (ﷺ) first entered upon \`Aisha. \`Aisha said to him, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You had sworn that you would not enter upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been counting them one by one.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'The (present) month is of twenty nine days.' \`Aisha added, 'Then Allah revealed the Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives he asked me first, and I chose him.' Then he gave option to his other wives and they said what \`Aisha had said . " (1) The Prophet, ' had decided to abstain from eating a certain kind of food because of a certain event, so Allah blamed him for doing so. Some of his wives were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted them for one month. See Qur'an:

And no soul knows what it shall earn tomorrow, and a soul knows not in what land it shall die. Verily Allah is Knowing, Aware." He (Abu Huraira) said: Then the person turned back and went away.

### Sahih Muslim 93
It is narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Ya'mur that the first man who discussed qadr (Divine Decree) in Basra was Ma'bad al-Juhani. I along with Humaid b. 'Abdur-Rahman Himyari set out for pilgrimage or for 'Umrah and said:Should it so happen that we come into contact with one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) we shall ask him about what is talked about taqdir (Divine Decree). Accidentally we came across Abdullah ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab, while he was entering the mosque. My companion and I surrounded him. One of us (stood) on his right and the other stood on his left. I expected that my companion would authorize me to speak. I therefore said: Abu Abdur Rahman! There have appeared some people in our land who recite the Qur'an and pursue knowledge. And then after talking about their affairs, added: They (such people) claim that there is no such thing as Divine Decree and events are not predestined. He (Abdullah ibn Umar) said: When you happen to meet such people tell them that I have nothing to do with them and they have nothing to do with me. And verily they are in no way responsible for my (belief). Abdullah ibn Umar swore by Him (the Lord) (and said): If any one of them (who does not believe in the Divine Decree) had with him gold equal to the bulk of (the mountain) Uhud and spent it (in the way of Allah), Allah would not accept it unless he affirmed his faith in Divine Decree. He further said: My father, Umar ibn al-Khattab, told me: One day we were sitting in the company of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) when there appeared before us a man dressed in pure white clothes, his hair extraordinarily black. There were no signs of travel on him. None amongst us recognized him. At last he sat with the Apostle (peace be upon him) He knelt before him placed his palms on his thighs and said: Muhammad, inform me about al-Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Al-Islam implies that you testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and you establish prayer, pay Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan, and perform pilgrimage to the (House) if you are solvent enough (to bear the expense of) the journey. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: It amazed us that he would put the question and then he would himself verify the truth. He (the inquirer) said: Inform me about Iman (faith). He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah, in His angels, in His Books, in His Apostles, in the Day of Judgment, and you affirm your faith in the Divine Decree about good and evil. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (the inquirer) again said: Inform me about al-Ihsan (performance of good deeds).

Iman in the hadith refers to the inner beliefs of the heart — the six articles that form the creed every Muslim must affirm with conviction. While Islam is the outward dimension, Iman is the inward. Without these beliefs being settled in the heart, outward actions lack their spiritual foundation.


**How?**

1. List the six articles of Iman as defined in the hadith: belief in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and divine decree.
2. For each article, write one sentence explaining what it means to you personally.
3. Identify which article you find most challenging to understand or feel weakest in — prioritise studying that one.
4. You have completed this when you can recite all six articles and explain each in your own words with conviction.` },

### Sahih Bukhari 50
Narrated Abu Huraira: One day while the Prophet (ﷺ) was sitting in the company of some people, (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, "What is faith?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, 'Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection." Then he further asked, "What is Islam?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "To worship Allah Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan." Then he further asked, "What is Ihsan (perfection)?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you." Then he further asked, "When will the Hour be established?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "The answerer has no better knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its portents. 1. When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master. 2. When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Allah. The Prophet (ﷺ) then recited: "Verily, with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour--." (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet (ﷺ) asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion." Abu 'Abdullah said: He (the Prophet) considered all that as a part of faith

### Sahih Muslim 93
It is narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Ya'mur that the first man who discussed qadr (Divine Decree) in Basra was Ma'bad al-Juhani. I along with Humaid b. 'Abdur-Rahman Himyari set out for pilgrimage or for 'Umrah and said:Should it so happen that we come into contact with one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) we shall ask him about what is talked about taqdir (Divine Decree). Accidentally we came across Abdullah ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab, while he was entering the mosque. My companion and I surrounded him. One of us (stood) on his right and the other stood on his left. I expected that my companion would authorize me to speak. I therefore said: Abu Abdur Rahman! There have appeared some people in our land who recite the Qur'an and pursue knowledge. And then after talking about their affairs, added: They (such people) claim that there is no such thing as Divine Decree and events are not predestined. He (Abdullah ibn Umar) said: When you happen to meet such people tell them that I have nothing to do with them and they have nothing to do with me. And verily they are in no way responsible for my (belief). Abdullah ibn Umar swore by Him (the Lord) (and said): If any one of them (who does not believe in the Divine Decree) had with him gold equal to the bulk of (the mountain) Uhud and spent it (in the way of Allah), Allah would not accept it unless he affirmed his faith in Divine Decree. He further said: My father, Umar ibn al-Khattab, told me: One day we were sitting in the company of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) when there appeared before us a man dressed in pure white clothes, his hair extraordinarily black. There were no signs of travel on him. None amongst us recognized him. At last he sat with the Apostle (peace be upon him) He knelt before him placed his palms on his thighs and said: Muhammad, inform me about al-Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Al-Islam implies that you testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and you establish prayer, pay Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan, and perform pilgrimage to the (House) if you are solvent enough (to bear the expense of) the journey. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: It amazed us that he would put the question and then he would himself verify the truth. He (the inquirer) said: Inform me about Iman (faith). He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah, in His angels, in His Books, in His Apostles, in the Day of Judgment, and you affirm your faith in the Divine Decree about good and evil. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (the inquirer) again said: Inform me about al-Ihsan (performance of good deeds). He (the Holy Prophet) said: That you worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you don't see Him, He, verily, sees you. He (the enquirer) again said: Inform me about the hour (of the Doom). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: One who is asked knows no more than the one who is inquiring (about it). He (the inquirer) said: Tell me some of its indications. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and master, that you will find barefooted, destitute goat-herds vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings. He (the narrator, Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: Then he (the inquirer) went on his way but I stayed with him (the Holy Prophet) for a long while.

Ihsan is the highest level of faith — constant God-consciousness. The Prophet (SAW) defined it as: "To worship Allah as though you see Him, and if you cannot see Him, then know that He sees you." This is the summit that Islam and Iman are meant to lead you toward.


**How?**

1. Memorise the definition of Ihsan from the hadith in Arabic and English.
2. During your next prayer, consciously apply this definition: pray as though you see Allah before you.
3. Identify one daily action (e.g., speaking, eating, working) and practice doing it with the awareness that Allah sees you.

The hadith of Jibril presents three levels — Islam, Iman, and Ihsan — as a ladder of spiritual growth. Honest self-assessment against these levels reveals where you stand and where your growth edge lies. Without this clarity, effort is scattered rather than targeted.


**How?**

1. Review the definitions of Islam (outward actions), Iman (inner beliefs), and Ihsan (God-consciousness).
2. Ask yourself: "Am I consistent in my outward actions (Islam)? Are my beliefs settled and free of doubt (Iman)? Do I worship with awareness that Allah sees me (Ihsan)?"

### Sahih Bukhari 3
Narrated 'Aisha (the mother of the faithful believers):The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright daylight, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food likewise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "I do not know how to read." The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous." (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, "Cover me! Cover me!" They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, "I fear that something may happen to me." Khadija replied, "Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones." Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, "Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!" Waraqa asked, "O my nephew! What have you seen?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, "This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, "Will they drive me out?" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, "Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly." But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while

The attributes of Allah are among the most debated topics in Islamic theology. Ahl al-Sunnah affirm them without distortion (*tahrif*), denial (*ta'til*), asking "how" (*takyif*), or likening to creation (*tamthil*). Understanding this methodology protects you from both extremes: denying what Allah affirmed and imagining Him in human terms.


**How?**

1. Read the section in your chosen text that discusses Allah's attributes (e.g., His hand, His face, His descending).
2. Study the four prohibited approaches: tahrif, ta'til, takyif, and tamthil. Write a one-line definition of each.
3. Practice applying the methodology: when you encounter an attribute like "Allah's hand" in the Quran, affirm it as real without imagining a form.

Matters of the unseen — angels, jinn, paradise, hellfire, the throne — are affirmed by revelation, not by human reason alone.

1. Read the section in your creed text that discusses the unseen: angels, paradise, hellfire, and the events of the Last Day.

The Prophet (SAW) said: "The thing I fear most for you is the minor shirk." They asked: "What is the minor shirk?" He said: "Ar-riya (showing off)."
*(Grade: Sahih — graded sahih by al-Albani)*`,
          description: `**Why?**

Minor shirk (*shirk asghar*) does not expel from Islam but is gravely sinful and can erode the sincerity of your worship. It includes acts like showing off in worship (riya), swearing by other than Allah, or saying "if it weren't for so-and-so." Its danger lies in how easily it goes unnoticed.


**How?**

1. Study the categories of minor shirk: verbal (e.g., swearing by other than Allah), practical (e.g., wearing amulets as "causes"), and internal (e.g., riya).
2. Identify which forms of minor shirk are most relevant to your own life and habits.
3. Learn the prophetic remedy: the du'a seeking refuge from shirk both known and unknown.
4. You have completed this when you can define minor shirk, list its common forms, and identify any that may apply to your own behaviour.` },

The Prophet (SAW) said: "The thing I fear most for you is the minor shirk — ar-riya (showing off)."
*(Grade: Sahih — graded sahih by al-Albani)*`,
          description: `**Why?**

The Prophet (SAW) called riya "hidden shirk" because it corrupts the sincerity of worship from within. It occurs when you beautify your worship to be seen by people — praying more carefully in public, giving charity for recognition, or seeking praise for religious knowledge. It is the most subtle threat to your Shahada.


**How?**

1. Study the hadith: "The thing I fear most for you is minor shirk — riya" (Ahmad 23630).
2. Examine your worship honestly: do you pray differently when others are watching? Do you share your good deeds for validation?
3. Practice three counter-measures: (a) perform hidden acts of worship regularly, (b) make du'a for sincerity before each act, (c) remind yourself that only Allah's acceptance matters.
4. You have completed this when you can describe what riya looks like in practice and have implemented at least one strategy to guard against it.` },

The Prophet (SAW) taught a specific du'a to protect against shirk — both the forms you recognise and the forms you do not. This du'a acknowledges human vulnerability to hidden shirk and turns the remedy itself into an act of worship and humility before Allah.


**How?**

1. Memorise the du'a: "Allahumma inni a'udhu bika an ushrika bika shay'an a'lamuhu, wa astaghfiruka lima la a'lamu" (O Allah, I seek refuge in You from associating anything with You knowingly, and I seek Your forgiveness for what I do not know).
2. Incorporate this du'a into your daily adhkar — say it at least once every morning and evening.
3. Study the hadith in which it was taught (narrated by Ahmad) and understand the context.
4. You have completed this when you have memorised the du'a in Arabic, understand its meaning, and have made it part of your daily routine.` },

Tawhid al-Rububiyyah — affirming that Allah alone is the Creator, Sustainer, and Controller of all affairs — is the foundation, but it alone is insufficient. Even the Quraysh of Mecca accepted that Allah created them (Quran 29:61-63), yet they were still polytheists because they did not single Him out in worship.


**How?**

1. Study the Quranic evidence for Rububiyyah: read 29:61-63 where the Quraysh affirm Allah as Creator yet worship others alongside Him.
2. Understand why acknowledgement of Allah as Creator does not automatically make someone a monotheist.
3. Reflect: do you know anyone (or any modern philosophy) that acknowledges a "higher power" but does not worship Allah alone?

Narrated Abu Huraira: One day while the Prophet (ﷺ) was sitting in the company of some people, (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, "What is faith?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, 'Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection." Then he further asked, "What is Islam?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "To worship Allah Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan." Then he further asked, "What is Ihsan (perfection)?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you." Then he further asked, "When will the Hour be established?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "The answerer has no better knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its portents. 1. When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master. 2. When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Allah. The Prophet (ﷺ) then recited: "Verily, with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour--." (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet (ﷺ) asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion." Abu 'Abdullah said: He (the Prophet) considered all that as a part of faith

### Sahih Bukhari 3
Narrated 'Aisha (the mother of the faithful believers):The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright daylight, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food likewise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "I do not know how to read." The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous." (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, "Cover me! Cover me!" They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, "I fear that something may happen to me." Khadija replied, "Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones." Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, "Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!" Waraqa asked, "O my nephew! What have you seen?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, "This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, "Will they drive me out?" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, "Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly." But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while

Tawhid al-Uluhiyyah — directing all acts of worship exclusively to Allah — is the core message of every prophet. Prayer, du'a, sacrifice, vows, love, fear, and hope must all be for Allah alone. This is where most deviations historically occur, and it is the dimension of Tawhid that the Quran emphasises most.


**How?**

1. List the major acts of worship: prayer, du'a, sacrifice, vows, reliance, love, fear, and hope.
2. For each one, verify: is this directed exclusively to Allah in my life, or does anything else compete for it?
3. Study Quran 6:162: "Say: Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds."

1. Study the principle: affirm what Allah and His Messenger affirmed, deny what they denied, and remain silent where they were silent.
2. Read about at least five of Allah's names (e.g., Ar-Rahman, Al-Alim, As-Samad, Al-Hayy, Al-Qayyum) and their meanings.

The three categories of Tawhid are not isolated compartments — they form a unified framework. Rububiyyah necessitates Uluhiyyah: if He is your Lord, then worship Him alone. And Asma wa Sifat informs both: knowing His attributes (e.g., that He is Ar-Razzaq, the Provider) leads to proper worship and trust.


**How?**

1. Draw or write out the three categories and how they connect: Rububiyyah (He is the Lord) leads to Uluhiyyah (so worship Him alone), and Asma wa Sifat (knowing who He is) deepens both.
2. Give one example of how knowing an attribute of Allah (e.g., Al-Basir — the All-Seeing) should change your behaviour.

Meaningful reflection requires stillness. Without dedicated, distraction-free time, your reflection will stay surface-level. Beginning with dhikr or du'a centres the heart on Allah before the mind begins to write — ensuring the reflection is spiritually grounded, not merely intellectual.


**How?**

1. Choose a 30-minute block where you will not be interrupted. Silence your phone and close unnecessary tabs.
2. Begin with 2-3 minutes of dhikr (e.g., SubhanAllah, Alhamdulillah, Allahu Akbar) or a brief du'a asking Allah for clarity and sincerity.
3. Have your journal or writing tool ready before you begin the dhikr so you can transition smoothly into writing.
4. You have completed this when you have sat down in a quiet space, completed your opening dhikr, and are ready to write.` },

Tawhid is tested not in comfort but in difficulty. The moments where believing in Allah alone required you to change a habit, leave a relationship, or make a difficult choice — these are where your Shahada was most real. Writing about them reveals the depth of your testimony.


**How?**

1. Think of a specific situation where your faith in Allah directly challenged something you were attached to — a habit, a relationship, a financial decision, or a social norm.
2. Write about what happened: what was the challenge, what did Tawhid demand, and what did you do?
3. Be honest about whether you followed through fully or compromised. Both outcomes are valuable for reflection.

Reflection without action is incomplete. Committing to one concrete, actionable change — however small — transforms this exercise from journaling into genuine spiritual growth. The Shahada demands ongoing alignment between declaration and life.


**How?**

1. Based on your reflection, identify one specific change you will make — not a vague aspiration, but a concrete action (e.g., "I will stop this specific habit," "I will begin praying Fajr on time," "I will remove this source of haram income").
2. Write it down as a commitment, including when you will start and how you will measure it.
3. Share it with someone who can hold you accountable, or set a reminder to check your progress in one week.

(Ibn ‘Abbâs said: "These are the five compulsory congregational prayers mentioned in the Qur’ân)." [Tafsir At-Tabari]

### Quran (11:114)
**Arabic:** 
**Translation:** And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât ), at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salât (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins). That is a reminder (an advice) for the mindful (those who accept advice).`,
          description: `**Why?**

Without reliable reminders, even sincere believers miss prayers due to distraction or busy schedules. Removing the burden of remembering frees your mind to focus on the prayer itself rather than worrying about the clock.


**How?**

Use a prayer time app (such as Muslim Pro or Athan) or set individual phone alarms for Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. Ensure reminders account for seasonal time changes. Test your setup for one full week and adjust alarm lead times so you have enough time to make wudu before the adhan.` },

**How?**

Create a simple log (notebook or app) with five columns for each day: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha. For each prayer, record whether it was on time, slightly delayed, or missed. At the end of the week, identify your weakest prayer and the most common reason for delays.` },

Shaytan's strategy is to make missing prayer feel justified through "reasonable" excuses. By naming your barriers explicitly and preparing countermeasures in advance, you remove the decision-making in the moment and protect your salah.


**How?**

List your top three barriers to prayer (e.g., oversleeping for Fajr, work meetings during Dhuhr, fatigue at Isha). For each barrier, write a specific countermeasure: a sleep routine for Fajr, a calendar block for Dhuhr, or praying Isha immediately after Maghrib to avoid delay.

The Prophet (SAW) was asked which deed is best and said: "Prayer at its proper time" (Bukhari/Muslim). Praying at the earliest time demonstrates eagerness to meet Allah and prevents the prayer from being crowded out by later obligations.


**How?**

For one week, aim to begin each prayer within 15 minutes of the adhan. Note your prayer time app's adhan alert and treat it as a hard deadline, not a suggestion. If you find certain prayers difficult to pray early, identify why and adjust your schedule accordingly.` },

Study the fard acts according to your madhab. Hanafi fard: wash face, wash arms to elbows, wipe one-quarter of the head, wash feet to ankles. Shafi'i adds intention (niyyah) and proper order (tartib). Consult a reliable fiqh manual and practice until you can list the fard acts from memory.` },

The sunnah acts of wudu perfect your purification and multiply your reward. They follow the example of the Prophet (SAW), who performed wudu with care and completeness. Neglecting them means leaving reward on the table.


**How?**

Learn and incorporate these sunnah acts: using miswak before wudu, saying bismillah, rinsing the mouth and nose, washing between the fingers and toes, wiping the ears, and starting with the right side before the left. Add them one at a time until the full sunnah wudu becomes your default.` },

Committing to just one prayer in congregation daily builds the habit without overwhelming your schedule. The Prophet (SAW) said that the reward for prayer in congregation is 27 times that of praying alone -- even one daily jama'ah multiplies your reward significantly.


**How?**

Choose the prayer that is most feasible for you to attend at the masjid -- Fajr if you live nearby, Isha if evenings work better, or Dhuhr if you work near a masjid. Commit to attending that one prayer in congregation every day for two weeks. Once it becomes routine, add a second prayer.` },

### Sahih Bukhari 1572
Ibn 'Abbas said that he has been asked regarding Hajj-at-Tamattu' on which he said:"The Muhajirin and the Ansar and the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) and we did the same. When we reached Makkah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Give up your intention of doing the Hajj (at this moment) and perform 'Umra, except the one who had garlanded the Hady." So, we performed Tawaf round the Ka'bah and [Sa'y] between As-safa and Al-MArwa, slept with our wives and wore ordinary (stitched) clothes. The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "Whoever has garlanded his Hady is not allowed to finish the Ihram till the Hady has reached its destination (has been sacrificed)". Then on the night of Tarwiya (8th Dhul Hijjah, in the afternoon) he ordered us to assume Ihram for Hajj and when we had performed all the ceremonies of Hajj, we came and performed Tawaf round the Ka'bah and (Sa'y) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa, and then our Hajj was complete, and we had to sacrifice a Hady according to the statement of Allah: "... He must slaughter a Hady such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should observe Saum (fasts) three days during the Hajj and seven days after his return (to his home)…." (V. 2:196). And the sacrifice of the sheep is sufficient. So, the Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions joined the two religious deeds, (i.e. Hajj and 'Umra) in one year, for Allah revealed (the permissibility) of such practice in His book and in the Sunna (legal ways) of His Prophet (ﷺ) and rendered it permissible for all the people except those living in Makkah. Allah says: "This is for him whose family is not present at the Al-Masjid-Al-Haram, (i.e. non resident of Makkah)." The months of Hajj which Allah mentioned in His book are: Shawwal, Dhul-Qa'da and Dhul-Hijjah. Whoever performed Hajj-at-Tamattu' in those months, then slaughtering or fasting is compulsory for him. The words: 1. Ar-Rafatha means sexual intercourse. 2. Al-Fasuq means all kinds of sin, and 3. Al-Jidal means to dispute

Jama'ah is not limited to the masjid. The Prophet (SAW) said prayer in congregation is 27 degrees better than praying alone. Even two people constitute a jama'ah, so there is almost always an opportunity to earn this multiplied reward at home.


**How?**

If you cannot reach a masjid, establish jama'ah at home. Pray with your spouse, child, parent, or roommate. One person leads (imam) and the other stands to the right. Teach family members the basics of following the imam if they are unfamiliar. Make it a household routine.` },

Understanding the boundary between permissible and excessive movement prevents you from either invalidating your prayer through carelessness or becoming unnecessarily anxious about minor, natural movements during salah.


**How?**

Study the scholarly position of your madhab on movement in salah. In the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools, three consecutive unnecessary movements invalidate the prayer.

Abu Bakr and \`Umar were also present among the people on that day but dared not talk to him (about his unfinished prayer). And the hasty people went away, wondering. "Has the prayer been shortened" Among the people there was a man whom the Prophet (ﷺ) used to call Dhul-Yadain (the longarmed). He said, "O Allah's Prophet! Have you forgotten or has the prayer been shortened?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Neither have I forgotten, nor has it been shortened." They (the people) said, "Surely, you have forgotten, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, Dhul-Yadain has told the truth." So the Prophet (ﷺ) got up and offered other two rak\`at and finished his prayer with Taslim. Then he said Takbir, performed a prostration of ordinary duration or longer, then he raised his head and said Takbir and performed another prostration of ordinary duration or longer and then raised his head and said Takbir (i.e. he performed the two prostrations of Sahu, i.e., forgetfulness)

Learn the three scenarios that require sujud al-sahw: addition (e.g., praying five rak'at instead of four), omission (e.g., skipping the first Tashahhud), and doubt (e.g., unsure if you prayed three or four rak'at). Study whether your madhab performs it before or after the salam. Practice by reviewing common scenarios.` },

Al-Fatihah is not a monologue -- it is a dialogue. In a hadith qudsi (Muslim), Allah responds to each verse: when you say "Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Alamin," Allah says "My servant has praised Me." Knowing this transforms every rak'ah into a personal conversation with your Lord.

Calculate the last third by dividing the time between Isha and Fajr into three equal parts. For example, if Isha is at 9 PM and Fajr at 6 AM, the last third begins at 3 AM. Set a weekly alarm for that time. Start with one night per week and work up from there.` },

### Quran (48:29)
**Arabic:** 
**Translation:** Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allāh; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allāh and [His] pleasure. Their sign is in their faces from the effect of prostration [i.e., prayer]. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that He [i.e., Allāh] may enrage by them the disbelievers. Allāh has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward.

### Quran (30:18)
**Arabic:** 
**Translation:** And His are all the praises and thanks in the heavens and the earth; and (glorify Him) in the afternoon (i.e. offer ‘Asr prayer) and when you come up to the time, when the day begins to decline (i.e. offer Zuhr prayer). (Ibn ‘Abbâs said: "These are the five compulsory congregational prayers mentioned in the Qur’ân)." [Tafsir At-Tabari]

### Quran (17:78)
**Arabic:** 
**Translation:** Establish regular prayers - at the sun's decline till the darkness of the night, and the morning prayer and reading: for the prayer and reading in the morning carry their testimony.

Ata told me that Ibn \`Abbas and Jabir bin \`Abdullah, had said, "There was no Adhan for the prayer of \`Id-ul-Fitr and \`Id-ul-Aqha." \`Ata' said, "I heard Jabir bin \`Abdullah saying, 'The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up and started with the prayer, and after it he delivered the Khutba. When the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) finished (the Khutba), he went to the women and preached to them, while he was leaning on Bilal's hand. Bilal was spreading his garment and the ladies were putting alms in it.'

It does not mean that dawn or morning has started." Then he (the Prophet) pointed with his fingers and raised them up (towards the sky) and then lowered them (towards the earth) like this (Ibn Mas\`ud imitated the gesture of the Prophet). Az-Zuhri gestured with his two index fingers which he put on each other and then stretched them to the right and left. These gestures illustrate the way real dawn appears. It spreads left and right horizontally. The dawn that appears in the high sky and lowers down is not the real dawn

Ibn al-Qayyim's classification of five levels of prayer provides a powerful self-diagnostic. Most people assume their prayer is "fine" without ever measuring it against a scholarly standard. Knowing your level is the first step to improving it.


**How?**

Read Ibn al-Qayyim's description in "al-Wabil al-Sayyib" or "as-Salah wa Hukm Tarikuha." The five levels range from the one who wrongs himself (negligent in wudu and timing) to the one who perfects prayer with full khushu'. Honestly identify which level describes your typical prayer. Set a goal to move up one level.` },

When he entered the Mosque, he disliked to leave it without offering a prayer. Ibn \`Umar narrated that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to visit the Mosque of Quba (sometime) walking and (sometime) riding. And he (i.e. Ibn \`Umar) used to say, "I do only what my companions used to do and I don't forbid anybody to pray at any time during the day or night except that one should not intend to pray at sunrise or sunset

Knowing the exact time window prevents you from accidentally praying outside it (which would not count as Duha) or missing it altogether because you thought the window had passed. The Duha window is wider than most people realise.

Duha begins approximately 15-20 minutes after sunrise and extends until shortly before Dhuhr. The preferred time is when the sun's heat intensifies (roughly mid-morning). Check your prayer app for sunrise time and add 20 minutes. Set a reminder in that window for your first week of practice.` },

The du'a of Sujud al-Tilawah is an act of profound humility -- you are declaring that your very face, the most honoured part of your body, submits to the One who created and shaped it. Knowing this du'a allows you to perform the prostration with both correctness and consciousness.


**How?**

Memorise the du'a: "Sajada wajhi lilladhi khalaqahu wa sawwarahu wa shaqqa sam'ahu wa basarahu, bi hawlihi wa quwwatihi" -- meaning "My face prostrates to the One who created it and formed it, and opened its hearing and sight by His might and power."

Those who disbelieve would want you to become heedless to your arms and your belongings, so that they come down upon you in a single move. There is no sin on you, if you have some inconvenience due to rain, or you are sick, in putting your arms aside, but take your precautionary measures.

Witr seals your night worship with an odd-numbered prayer, as the Prophet (SAW) instructed. It includes the Qunut du'a, one of the most comprehensive supplications in the Sunnah. Making Witr your last prayer of the night follows prophetic guidance directly.


**How?**

After completing your Qiyam rak'at, pray Witr as the final prayer of the night. You may pray 1 rak'ah or 3 rak'at. In the last rak'ah, after rising from ruku, recite the Qunut du'a: "Allahumma-hdini fi man hadayt..." If you fear you may not wake for Tahajjud, pray Witr before sleeping.` },

Track your Qiyam streak for 30 consecutive days using a simple checklist or app. If you miss a night, do not abandon the effort -- resume the next night and restart the count. The goal is to reach 30 consecutive nights, at which point the habit will feel natural. Record which nights were hardest and plan around those obstacles.` },

Subtract your immediate debts and obligations from your total zakatable wealth. If the remainder exceeds the nisab and a full lunar year (hawl) has passed since you first held nisab-level wealth, zakah of 2.5% is due on the total zakatable amount.` },

Most modern wealth is held as cash rather than gold or silver. Understanding that cash follows the same zakah rules ensures you do not overlook the largest portion of your zakatable assets.

Trade goods (uruud al-tijarah) are a major category of zakatable wealth. Entrepreneurs and business owners must understand how to value and assess zakah on their inventory to fulfil this obligation properly.


**How?**

On your zakah date, value all business inventory held for sale at its current market price (not cost price). The zakah rate is 2.5% of the total market value. Items purchased for personal use or business operations (like equipment) are exempt. Only goods intended for resale count.` },

Agricultural and livestock zakah have distinct rules that differ significantly from monetary zakah. If you earn from farming or animal husbandry, these specific rates apply and must be studied separately.


**How?**

For crops: zakah is 10% of the harvest if rain-watered, and 5% if irrigated with paid water. This is due at harvest time, not annually.

Knowing what is exempt prevents you from over-calculating your zakah and gives you clarity on the boundary between personal possessions and zakatable wealth. Islam does not tax you on what you need to live.

Exclude from your zakah calculation: your primary residence, personal clothing, household furniture and appliances, vehicles for personal transport, and tools of your trade.

The fuqara are the first category Allah mentions in the zakah verse (9:60). Recognising who qualifies as 'poor' ensures your zakah reaches those with the most urgent need.

The masakin are often invisible -- they have some means but not enough. Recognising this category prevents zakah from being directed only to the visibly destitute while others quietly suffer.

Pay the full calculated amount as soon as possible. Make a clear intention (niyyah) in your heart that this payment is zakah.

Narrated 'Ubada bin As-Samit:"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out to inform the people about the (date of the) night of decree (Al-Qadr) but there happened a quarrel between two Muslim men. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "I came out to inform you about (the date of) the night of Al-Qadr, but as so and so and so and so quarrelled, its knowledge was taken away (I forgot it) and maybe it was better for you.

A fixed annual date eliminates guesswork and procrastination. Many Muslims choose Ramadan for the multiplied reward, but any consistent date fulfils the requirement.


**How?**

Pick a date you can remember and commit to -- 1st Ramadan is popular for its barakah, but 1st Muharram or your birthday also work. Record it in both Hijri and Gregorian calendars. This becomes your permanent zakah anniversary. Every year on this date, you will calculate and pay.` },

*(Grade: Sahih)*`,
          description: `**Why?**

Without reminders, zakah dates can slip by unnoticed, leading to delayed payment. A reminder system ensures you have time to prepare your financial records before the due date.

Zakah al-Fitr purifies the fasting person from any shortcomings during Ramadan and provides food for the poor on Eid day. Knowing the correct amount ensures your payment is valid.


**How?**

The amount is one sa' (approximately 2.5-3 kg) of a staple food per person -- dates, barley, wheat, rice, or the local equivalent.

*(Grade: Sahih)*`,
          description: `**Why?**

The timing of Zakah al-Fitr is a condition of its validity. Paying after the Eid prayer downgrades it to regular charity, and the obligation remains unfulfilled. Knowing the window prevents this mistake.


**How?**

The preferred time is before the Eid prayer on 1st Shawwal. Paying 1-2 days before Eid is permissible and recommended by many scholars to give recipients time to prepare for Eid.

Count every person you are financially responsible for: yourself, your spouse, your children (including a newborn born before Eid), and elderly parents under your care.

Before paying zakah, sit with your intention. Notice any reluctance or tightness in your heart -- this is precisely what zakah is designed to treat.

(2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." \`Aisha said, "O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, 'It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.' But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume Ihram for worshipping an idol called "Manat" which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) regarding it, saying, "O Allah's Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." So Allah revealed: 'Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.' " Aisha added, "Surely, Allah's Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them." Later on I (\`Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin \`Abdur-Rahman (of \`Aisha's narration) and he said, 'I have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom \`Aisha mentioned and who used to assume Ihram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka\`ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Qur'an, the people asked, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka\`ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?' So Allah revealed: "Verily As-Safa and Al- Marwa are among the symbols of Allah." Abu Bakr said, "It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre- Islamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka\`ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka\`ba

Narrated 'Aisha (the mother of the faithful believers):The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright daylight, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food likewise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "I do not know how to read." The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous." (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, "Cover me! Cover me!" They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, "I fear that something may happen to me." Khadija replied, "Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones." Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, "Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!" Waraqa asked, "O my nephew! What have you seen?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, "This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, "Will they drive me out?" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, "Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly." But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while

Waqf is one of the most powerful forms of sadaqah jariyah -- an endowment whose rewards continue flowing to you even after death. Understanding its principles opens the door to leaving a lasting legacy.


**How?**

Study the Islamic principles of waqf: an asset is dedicated permanently to a charitable purpose, the original asset (the 'ayn') is preserved and cannot be sold, and only its returns or benefits are distributed. Learn the difference between waqf ahli (family endowment) and waqf khayri (public charitable endowment). Read about historical awqaf that funded hospitals, schools, and masjids for centuries.` },

You do not need to be wealthy to participate in waqf. Modern platforms offer collective waqf options where many contributors pool resources to create a larger endowment, making this form of ongoing charity accessible to everyone.

Walking someone through the calculation step by step demystifies zakah and empowers them to do it independently in future years. Teaching is one of the highest forms of sadaqah.

The niyyah distinguishes a genuine act of worship from mere hunger. Without a conscious intention directed to Allah, the fast has no spiritual weight.

Knowing the exact boundaries of the fast protects its validity. Eating even a moment after Fajr or breaking fast before Maghrib can invalidate the entire day.


**How?**

Fasting begins at the onset of Fajr (true dawn) and ends at Maghrib (sunset). Eating during suhoor is permissible until the Fajr adhan. Use a reliable prayer-time app for precise times in your location and stop eating a few minutes before Fajr as a safety margin.` },

The physical restraints of fasting are the pillars that hold the fast together. Ignorance of the basics risks repeated invalid fasts and unnecessary guilt.

Delaying make-up fasts without awareness of the deadline can compound your obligation. Some scholars hold that unjustified delay adds fidyah on top of qada.

The Prophet (SAW) called fasting a shield (Bukhari). It is not merely about hunger — it trains you to govern your tongue and temper, which are far harder to control than appetite.

Qais bin Sirma-al-Ansari was fasting and came to his wife at the time of Iftar (breaking one's fast) and asked her whether she had anything to eat. She replied, "No, but I would go and bring some for you." He used to do hard work during the day, so he was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. When his wife came and saw him, she said, "Disappointment for you." When it was midday on the following day, he fainted and the Prophet (ﷺ) was informed about the whole matter and the following verses were revealed: "You are permitted To go to your wives (for sexual relation) At the night of fasting."

Then, if he rides and proceeds to \`Arafat, he should take a Hadi (i.e. animal for sacrifice), either a camel or a cow or a sheep, whatever he can afford; but if he cannot afford it, he should fast for three days during the Hajj before the day of \`Arafat, but if the third day of his fasting happens to be the day of \`Arafat (i.e. 9th of Dhul-Hijja) then it is no sin for him (to fast on it). Then he should proceed to \`Arafat and stay there from the time of the \`Asr prayer till darkness falls. Then the pilgrims should proceed from \`Arafat, and when they have departed from it, they reach Jam' (i.e. Al-Muzdalifa) where they ask Allah to help them to be righteous and dutiful to Him, and there they remember Allah greatly or say Takbir (i.e. Allah is Greater) and Tahlil (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah) repeatedly before dawn breaks. Then, after offering the morning (Fajr) prayer you should pass on (to Mina) for the people used to do so and Allah said:-- "Then depart from the place whence all the people depart. And ask for Allah's Forgiveness. Truly! Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." (2.199) Then you should go on doing so till you throw pebbles over the Jamra

He said, "I see that you do not touch except the two Yemenite corners of the Ka\`ba (while performing the Tawaf): and I see you wearing the Sabtiyya shoes; and I see you dyeing (your hair) with Sufra; and I see that when you are in Mecca, the people assume the state of Ihram on seeing the crescent (on the first day of Dhul-Hijja) while you do not assume the state of Ihram till the Day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul Hijja)." \`Abdullah bin \`Umar said to him, "As for the corners of the Ka\`ba, I have not seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) touching except the two Yemenite corners, As for the Sabtiyya shoes, I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) wearing leather shoes that had no hair, and he used to perform the ablution while wearing them. Therefore, I like to wear such shoes. As regards dyeing with Sufra, I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) dyeing his hair with it, so I like to dye (my hair) with it. As regards the crescent (of Dhul-Hijja), I have not seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) assuming the state of Ihram till his she-camel set out (on the 8th of Dhul-Hijja)

(2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." \`Aisha said, "O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, 'It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.' But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume Ihram for worshipping an idol called "Manat" which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) regarding it, saying, "O Allah's Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." So Allah revealed: 'Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.' " Aisha added, "Surely, Allah's Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them." Later on I (\`Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin \`Abdur-Rahman (of \`Aisha's narration) and he said, 'I have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom \`Aisha mentioned and who used to assume Ihram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka\`ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Qur'an, the people asked, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!

Narrated Ibn \`Umar:During the last Hajj (Hajj-al-Wada\`) of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he performed \`Umra and Hajj. He drove a Hadi along with him from Dhul-Hulaifa. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) started by assuming Ihram for \`Umra and Hajj. And the people, too, performed the \`Umra and Hajj along with the Prophet. Some of them brought the Hadi and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet (ﷺ) arrived at Mecca. he said to the people, "Whoever among you has driven the Hadi, should not finish his Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hadi with him, should perform Tawaf of the Ka\`ba and the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a Hadi (sacrifice); and if anyone cannot afford a Hadi, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home. The Prophet (ﷺ) performed Tawaf of the Ka\`ba on his arrival (at Mecca); he touched the (Black Stone) corner first of all and then did Ramal (fast walking with moving of the shoulders) during the first three rounds round the Ka\`ba, and during the last four rounds he walked. After finishing Tawaf of the Ka\`ba, he offered a two rak\`at prayer at Maqam Ibrahim, and after finishing the prayer he went to Safa and Marwa and performed seven rounds of Tawaf between them and did not do any deed forbidden because of Ihram, till he finished all the ceremonies of his Hajj and sacrificed his Hadi on the day of Nahr (10th day of Dhul-Hijja). He then hastened onwards (to Mecca) and performed Tawaf of the Ka\`ba and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihram became permissible. Those who took and drove the Hadi with them did the same as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did

The two persons kept on standing before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for a while and then one of them found a place in the circle and sat there while the other sat behind the gathering, and the third one went away. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) finished his preaching, he said, "Shall I tell you about these three persons? One of them betook himself to Allah, so Allah took him into His grace and mercy and accommodated him, the second felt shy from Allah, so Allah sheltered Him in His mercy (and did not punish him), while the third turned his face from Allah and went away, so Allah turned His face from him likewise

Narrated \`Umar:My Ansari neighbor from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live at \`Awali Al-Medina and I used to visit the Prophet (ﷺ) by turns. He used to go one day and I another day. When I went I used to bring the news of that day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. Once my Ansari friend, in his turn (on returning from the Prophet), knocked violently at my door and asked if I was there." I became horrified and came out to him. He said, "Today a great thing has happened." I then went to Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked her, "Did Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) divorce you all?" She replied, "I do not know." Then, I entered upon the Prophet (ﷺ) and said while standing, "Have you divorced your wives?" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied in the negative. On that I said, "Allahu-Akbar (Allah is Greater)."

Standing at Arafah is the essence of Hajj. It is a rehearsal for the Day of Judgement -- millions standing in white garments, equal before Allah, with nothing but their deeds. The Prophet (SAW) said Hajj is Arafah.


**How?**

Study the significance of the Day of Arafah in hadith literature. Visualise the scene: stripped of all worldly markers of status, standing under the open sky, begging Allah for forgiveness. Reflect on what you would say to Allah if this were your last chance, and begin making those du'as now.` },

Anas b. Malik reported on the authority of Malik b. Sa sa', perhaps a person of his tribe, that the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) said:I was near the House (i. e. Ka'bah) in a state between sleep and wakefulness when I heard someone say: He is the third among the two persons. Then he came to me and took me with him. Then a golden basin containing the water of Zamzam was brought to me and my heart was opened up to such and such (part). Qatada said: I asked him who was with me (i e. the narrator) and what he meant by such and such (part). He replied: (It means that it was opened) up to the lower part of his abdomen (Then the hadith continues): My heart was extracted and it was washed with the water of Zamzam and then it was restored in its original position, after which it was filled with faith and wisdom. I was then brought a white beast which is called al-Buraq, bigger than a donkey and smaller than a mule. Its stride was as long as the eye could reach. I was mounted on it, and then we went forth till we reached the lowest heaven. Gabriel asked for the (gate) to be opened, and it was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was again said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad (ﷺ). It was said: Has he been sent for? He (Gabriel) said: Yes. He (the Prophet) said: Then (the gate) was opened for us (and it was said): Welcome unto him! His is a blessed arrival. Then we came to Adam (peace be upon him). And he (the narrator) narrated the whole account of the hadith. (The Holy Prophet) observed that he met Jesus in the second heaven, Yahya (peace be on both of them) in the third heaven, Yusuf in the third, Idris in the fourth, Harun in the fifth (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them). Then we travelled on till we reached the sixth heaven and came to Moses (peace be upon him) and I greeted him and he said: Welcome unto righteous brother and righteous prophet. And when I passed (by him) he wept, and a voice was heard saying: What makes thee weep? He said: My Lord, he is a young man whom Thou hast sent after me (as a prophet) and his followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers. Then we travelled on till we reached the seventh heaven and I came to Ibrahim. He (the narrator) narrat- ed in this hadith that the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) told that he saw four rivers which flowed from (the root of the lote-tree of the farthest limits): two manifest rivers and two hidden rivers. I said: ' Gabriel! what are these rivers? He replied: The two hidden rivers are the rivers of Paradise, and as regards the two manifest ones, they are the Nile and the Euphrates. Then the Bait-ul-Ma'mur was raised up to me. I said: O Gabriel! what is this? He replied: It is the Bait-ul-Ma'mur. Seventy thousand angels enter into it daily and, after they come out, they never return again. Two vessels were then brought to me. The first one contained wine and the second one contained milk, and both of them were placed before me. I chose milk. It was said: You did right. Allah will guide rightly through you your Ummah on the natural course. Then fifty prayers daily were made obligatory for me. And then he narrated the rest of the hadith to the end

### Sahih Bukhari 3
Narrated 'Aisha (the mother of the faithful believers):The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright daylight, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food likewise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "I do not know how to read." The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous." (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, "Cover me! Cover me!" They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, "I fear that something may happen to me." Khadija replied, "Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones." Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, "Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!" Waraqa asked, "O my nephew! What have you seen?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, "This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, "Will they drive me out?" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, "Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly."

### Quran (3:97)
**Arabic:** وَلِلَّهِ عَلَى النَّاسِ حِجُّ الْبَيْتِ مَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلًا  
**Translation:** Pilgrimage to the House is a duty owed to God by people who are able to undertake it.

**I. Hadith**


### Sahih Bukhari 1773
The Prophet (SAW) said: "An Umrah to the next Umrah is an expiation for what is between them, and Hajj Mabrur has no reward except Paradise."
*(Grade: Sahih)*`,
          description: `**Why?**

Whether you sponsor a full Hajj or contribute partially, the reward is immense. Enabling someone to worship Allah at His House is a form of ongoing sadaqah whose reward multiplies through every du'a that pilgrim makes.


**How?**

Decide on a contribution amount based on your means. Donate through the verified programme you identified. If sponsoring fully, coordinate with the programme to understand the pilgrim's needs. Make du'a that Allah accepts both the pilgrim's Hajj and your contribution as a means of drawing closer to Him.` },

**Arabic:** 
**Translation:** so let the pilgrims perform their acts of cleansing, fulfil their vows, and circle around the Ancient House.’`,
          description: `**Why?**

Your du'a for them in their absence is answered by an angel who says "And for you the same." This reciprocal blessing means that praying for the pilgrim's accepted Hajj and forgiveness returns the same to you.


**How?**

Pray that Allah accepts their Hajj, forgives their sins, and returns them home renewed in faith. Make this du'a consistently during their journey, especially on the Day of Arafah. Ask them to make du'a for you at the sacred sites as well, creating a bond of mutual supplication.` },

### Quran (2:197)
**Arabic:** 
**Translation:** Ḥajj is [during] well-known months, so whoever has made ḥajj obligatory upon himself therein [by entering the state of iḥrām], there is [to be for him] no sexual relations and no disobedience and no disputing during ḥajj. And whatever good you do - Allāh knows it. And take provisions, but indeed, the best provision is fear of Allāh. And fear Me, O you of understanding.`,

Documenting your learning journey creates a resource for both yourself and others. The questions you struggled with, the books that helped, and the practical preparations you made are exactly what future pilgrims need to know.


**How?**

Start a journal (digital or physical) that tracks: what books and courses you study, what fiqh questions arise and how you resolve them, what practical preparations you make (fitness, packing, finances), and any spiritual reflections along the way. Date each entry so it forms a timeline others can follow.` },

**Translation:** And proclaim to the people the Hajj; they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel from every distant pass. That they may witness benefits for themselves.

### Quran (22:37)
**Arabic:** لَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلَا دِمَاؤُهَا وَلَٰكِن يَنَالُهُ التَّقْوَىٰ مِنكُمْ  
**Translation:** Their meat will not reach Allah, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety (taqwa) from you.

### Sahih Muslim 1893
The Prophet (SAW) said: "Whoever guides someone to goodness will have a reward like that of the one who does it."
*(Grade: Sahih)*`,
          description: `**Why?**

Many Muslims feel overwhelmed by Hajj preparation because they lack accessible, personal guidance. Your lived experience and lessons learned can demystify the process and inspire others to begin their own preparation.


**How?**

Host a Hajj preparation session at your local masjid or with family. Share what you have learned about the fiqh, logistics, and spiritual dimensions of the pilgrimage. Use your journal notes as the foundation. Be honest about challenges and uncertainties -- authenticity is more helpful than polish.` },

**Translation:** Complete the pilgrimages, major and minor, for the sake of God.

**I. Hadith**


### Sahih Bukhari 1773
The Prophet (SAW) said: "Hajj Mabrur has no reward except Paradise." Sharing preparation resources helps future pilgrims achieve a Hajj accepted by Allah.
*(Grade: Sahih)*`,
          description: `**Why?**

A curated resource list saves future pilgrims from the overwhelming task of finding quality Hajj preparation materials on their own. Your personal recommendations carry weight because they are tested, not theoretical.


**How?**

Compile a list of the best resources you found: recommended books, online courses, du'a booklets, packing checklists, and any apps that were helpful. Annotate each with a brief note on why you recommend it. Share the list digitally (PDF, shared document, or community group) for easy access and updating.` },
