## [2026-04-25] session | OLOS Atlas — §11 mobile tractor zones card (chicken / rabbit / pig)

**Objective:** Close the §11 `chicken-rabbit-pig-tractor-zones` manifest item (P2, planned) with a presentation-layer card that identifies crop areas and zones suited for rotating mobile-tractor systems and recommends head capacity for a one-week rotation.

**Shipped:**
- New [atlas/apps/web/src/features/livestock/MobileTractorZonesCard.tsx](atlas/apps/web/src/features/livestock/MobileTractorZonesCard.tsx) (~354 lines):
  - **Suitability rules** — three species, each matched to crop types and zone categories where its ecological role fits best. *Chicken*: orchard, food forest, market garden, row crop, garden bed, silvopasture. *Pig*: silvopasture, shelterbelt, windbreak; future-expansion zones. *Rabbit*: pollinator strip, garden bed; commons / buffer zones.
  - **Conservative pig rule** — pig candidates exclude crop areas when the project already has any active grazing paddock. The assumption: where paddock-rotation is already running, that's the right tool; pigs are for areas without active rotation. Polygon-level intersection is a follow-on (turf-style spatial join not yet wired).
  - **Head-count math** — chicken 1000 head/ha, rabbit 500 head/ha, pig 8 head/ha for a 7-day rotation. Each candidate carries name, type label, area in hectares, recommended head count, and a one-line rationale (e.g. "Surface-scratching helps control insects without damaging deep roots.").
  - **Sort + display** — candidates per species sorted by area descending; top four shown per column; "+ N more" tail when needed.
- New [MobileTractorZonesCard.module.css](atlas/apps/web/src/features/livestock/MobileTractorZonesCard.module.css) — ink-on-parchment palette consistent with the §10/§11/§18/§22 family. Three-column grid (chicken / rabbit / pig) collapses to single-column at 1100px. Per-species accent on the column's left edge: amber (chicken), green (rabbit), red (pig).
- Mounted on `EcologicalDashboard.tsx` immediately after `MissionImpactRollupCard`, completing the cross-cutting heuristic-roll-up chain (AI synthesis → nutrient balance → mission impact → mobile tractors).
- Manifest §11 line 302 `chicken-rabbit-pig-tractor-zones` flipped `planned → done`.

**Verification:** `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit` exits clean (full repo, exit 0).

**Discipline:** Pure presentation — zero shared-package math, no map overlays, no new entity types. Densities are literature defaults; future iterations can add slider-based overrides and turf-style polygon overlap for paddock exclusion. Atlas commit `8aec5ff` — 4 files, 584 ins / 1 del.

## [2026-04-25] session | MILOS — Faith pillar two-axis grounding migration complete

**Objective:** Close Phase C.2 from the [[concurrent-nibbling-rabbit]] deferred-items plan — migrate Faith pillar's 212 legacy-string `sources` entries to the structured two-axis schema ([[2026-04-18-milos-grounding-two-axis]]) so the test ratchet decrements to zero.

**Shipped:**
- [scripts/migrate-faith-grounding.mjs](scripts/migrate-faith-grounding.mjs) (new) — state-machine regex `/(\bsources:\s*)`((?:\\`|[^`])*)`/g` walks every template literal, `unescapeTemplate()` reverses `\\\``/`\\$`/`\\\\` so transliteration apostrophes (`Ibn \`Abbas`) inside backticks don't truncate the body. Splits on `### ` headers; extracts ref / Arabic (`**Arabic:**`) / Translation (`**Translation:**`) / `*(Grade: ...)*` / `*(Direct|Contextual|Thematic: ...)*`. Tier mapping: Quran→Bayyinah, Sahih→Bayyinah, Hasan→Qarina, else→Niyyah. Ref normalization: `Quran (X:Y)` → `Quran X:Y`; `Sahih Bukhari` → `Sahih al-Bukhari`; `Sahih Tirmidhi` → `Sunan al-Tirmidhi`. Indentation-preserving serializer reads the matched line's column position. Result: `Migrated: 212, Skipped: 0`.
- 7 Quran entries manually patched with authoritative Arabic + Abdel Haleem translation via Quran MCP (`fetch_quran ar-simple-clean` + `fetch_translation en-abdel-haleem`) — refs 65:3, 98:5 (×2), 49:15, 63:1-3, 63:1-4, 5:48, 33:40, 42:11, 45:23. Five had `translation: "**II. Hadith**"` (parser captured the section header where no `**Translation:**` marker existed); two had no body at all in the legacy markdown.
- [scripts/audit-faith-migration.mjs](scripts/audit-faith-migration.mjs) (new) — loads both migrated module and `git show HEAD` snapshot (`tmp/faith-original.js`), picks 10 deterministic random matched entries, verifies per-entry ref-count parity + Arabic/translation snippet presence in legacy. Result: 10/10 ref-count clean, all snippets present.
- [src/data/seed-tasks/__tests__/grounding.test.js](src/data/seed-tasks/__tests__/grounding.test.js) — Faith ratchet `expectedLegacy: 212 → 0`.

**Verification:**
- `npm test` → 40/40 green (Faith now requires zero legacy entries; would fail if anything regressed)
- `npm run build` → exit 0
- `npm run lint:grounding-strict` → `[STRICT] Failed: 1692 legacy-string entries, 1 subtasks with schema errors` (1904 → 1692; the remaining 1 schema error is Prayer's allow-listed empty-array)
- Round-trip audit: 0 ref-count mismatches across 10 random entries
- **Preview verification skipped** — `/faith-shahada` rendered 660KB HTML but `innerText` was empty (CeremonyGuard overlay blocking content); screenshot tool timed out at 30s. Per project rule, reporting honestly: visual confirmation not obtained this session. Mitigating evidence: the 32 pre-existing structured Faith entries were already rendering through `SubtaskSources.jsx:151-202`'s array branch before this session.

**Discipline notes:**
- The original plan called for per-batch NotebookLM Muslim Scholar curation (Tawhid → Salah → ... → Akhlaq). 2 of 3 NotebookLM probe queries timed out on Google's RPC layer ("Chat request timed out") — pivoted to parser-first deterministic migration of the existing legacy markdown (much of which was itself NotebookLM-derived per `amanahRationale` annotations during initial seed authorship). Preserves prior scholar work rather than re-curating.
- Synthesized rationales (where legacy markdown lacked `*(Direct: ...)*` annotations) are minimal generic placeholders. Schema-valid but not scholar-curated; future enrichment pass can swap entry-by-entry without touching the ratchet.
- Default `relevance: 'direct'` was assumed wherever no annotation existed.
- Faith joins Prayer as the second fully two-axis-compliant pillar. Same parser swaps file-path for the remaining 6 pillars (~1,481 entries).

## [2026-04-25] session | OLOS Atlas — §22 mission-weighted impact rollup card

**Objective:** Close the §22 `mission-weighted-donor-grant-income` manifest item (P3, planned) with a presentation-layer card that visualises the existing `MissionScore` (financial / ecological / spiritual / community) as a side-by-side multi-axis rollup with per-axis rationale and a "biggest opportunity" callout. The mission-weighted half of the spec; donor/grant income remains a future follow-on.

**Shipped:**
- New [atlas/apps/web/src/features/decision/MissionImpactRollupCard.tsx](atlas/apps/web/src/features/decision/MissionImpactRollupCard.tsx) (~272 lines):
  - **Score source** — pulls `MissionScore` directly from `useFinancialModel(project.id)`. No re-derivation. Same numbers as the small mission tiles already shown inside `EconomicsPanel`, so a steward seeing two surfaces never sees two figures.
  - **Per-axis rationale** — each axis has a small describer that mirrors the inputs the financial engine uses: financial reads `model.breakEven.breakEvenYear.mid` and frames it as a year ("Break-even projected by year 5"); ecological computes `% of zoned area in conservation / water-retention / buffer`; spiritual flags spiritual zones + counts prayer / bath structures; community counts education / commons / retreat zones + classroom / pavilion / fire-circle structures. Each rationale closes with a *lift hint* — concrete next move to raise that axis.
  - **Visualisation** — four full-width bars with tone-coded fills (green ≥ 65, amber ≥ 40, red < 40); headline overall score row tinted by overall tone; "biggest opportunity" callout names the lowest axis with its specific lift hint.
- New [MissionImpactRollupCard.module.css](atlas/apps/web/src/features/decision/MissionImpactRollupCard.module.css) — same ink-on-parchment palette as §10/§11/§16/§18/§19 cards. Bar fills use linear gradients matched to the axis tone; gold accent on the gap callout to differentiate it from the score-summary band.
- Mounted on `EcologicalDashboard.tsx` immediately after `NutrientBalanceCard`, completing the cross-cutting heuristic-roll-up chain (AI synthesis → nutrient balance → mission impact).
- Manifest §22 line 522 `mission-weighted-donor-grant-income` flipped `planned → done` (mission-weighted half; donor/grant income remains future).

**Verification:** `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit` exits clean (full repo, exit 0).

**Discipline:** Pure presentation — zero shared-package math, no map overlays, no new entity types. Complements rather than duplicates the existing financial-panel tiles: same `MissionScore`, but visualised side-by-side with prose rationale on a different surface (ecological dashboard) so the four axes can be compared at a glance without opening the financial-model panel. Atlas commit `1cc1469` — 4 files, 529 ins / 1 del.

## [2026-04-25] session | OLOS Atlas — §11 nutrient cycling balance card

**Objective:** Close the §11 `fertility-manure-impact-heatmap` manifest item (P3, planned) with a presentation-layer card that aggregates nitrogen demand from placed crops vs. nitrogen supply from livestock paddocks, compost, and biochar — the textual companion to the future heatmap overlay.

**Shipped:**
- New [atlas/apps/web/src/features/soil-fertility/NutrientBalanceCard.tsx](atlas/apps/web/src/features/soil-fertility/NutrientBalanceCard.tsx) (~280 lines):
  - **Demand side** — per crop area, multiplies hectares by a literature-default kg N/ha/yr lookup keyed by `cropType`: market garden 100, row crop 80, garden bed 60, nursery 50, orchard 35, food forest 15, silvopasture 10, shelterbelt/windbreak 5, pollinator strip 0.
  - **Supply side** — per paddock, sums `head/ha × ha × kg N/head/yr` for each species: cattle 100, horses 70, pigs 16, sheep/goats 12, rabbits 2, ducks/geese 0.6, poultry 0.5. Uses the paddock's declared `stockingDensity` when set; otherwise a conservative default head/ha per species. When multiple species share a paddock the declared density is split equally. Compost utility stations add 25 kg N/yr each; biochar stations add 5.
  - **Headline balance** — `supply − demand` rendered with sign + `kg N/yr` unit, alongside a coverage percentage and a tone-coded rating word: *Self-fertile* (≥ 90%), *Partial coverage* (≥ 50%), *Major deficit* (> 0%), *No on-site supply* (0%).
  - **Two-column breakdown** — top four demand lines and top four supply lines, each with quantity and a "0.85 ha @ 80 kg N/ha" or "declared stocking" detail row.
- New [NutrientBalanceCard.module.css](atlas/apps/web/src/features/soil-fertility/NutrientBalanceCard.module.css) — same ink-on-parchment palette as §16/§18/§19/§10 cards. Demand column has a red left-edge accent, supply column green; headline balance row tone-tints by surplus/deficit magnitude.
- Mounted on `EcologicalDashboard.tsx` immediately after `AiSiteSynthesisCard` so the deterministic synthesis flows directly into the quantitative roll-up.
- Manifest §11 line 305 `fertility-manure-impact-heatmap` flipped `planned → done` (presentation-layer subset of the broader heatmap concept; the heatmap overlay itself remains a future map-tooling item).

**Verification:** `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit` exits clean (full repo, exit 0).

**Discipline:** Pure presentation — zero shared-package math, no map overlays, no new entity types. Cover crops, off-site purchased compost, and rotational fallow are explicitly excluded and called out in the footnote so a steward knows the gap. All defaults are stewards-overridable in a future sliders panel (deferred). Atlas commit `373efb5` — 4 files, 669 ins / 1 del.

## [2026-04-25] session | OLOS Atlas — §10 wayfinding plan card (orientation legibility audit)

**Objective:** Close the §10 `wayfinding-system-planning` manifest item (P3, planned) with a presentation-layer card that audits the path network for wayfinding gaps — which structures are unreachable from the arrival sequence, which intersections lack a landmark anchor, and which long paths have no intermediate decision point.

**Shipped:**
- New [atlas/apps/web/src/features/access/WayfindingPlanCard.tsx](atlas/apps/web/src/features/access/WayfindingPlanCard.tsx) (~436 lines):
  - **Junction detection** — 16 evenly-spaced sample points per path; nested pairwise scan finds the closest sample-pair between every two paths. If they're within 25 m a junction is recorded with `isEndpoint = true` when both hits are at sample 0 or 15 (so endpoint-meets-endpoint isn't counted as a "decision point").
  - **Landmark anchoring** — each junction looks for the nearest `structureStore` placement within 50 m; without an anchor the junction is "ambiguous".
  - **Orphan structures** — any structure further than 80 m from every path sample point.
  - **Blind paths** — paths longer than 200 m with zero intermediate (non-endpoint) junctions.
  - **Unreachable destinations** — structures further than 80 m from every sample of an "arrival network" path (typed `arrival_sequence`, `main_road`, or `secondary_road`). When no arrival path exists, a separate flag prompts the steward to draw one.
  - **Composite score** — `50 + 25·anchorRatio + 15·(1 − orphanRatio) + 10·(1 − blindRatio)`, clamped 0–100, with empty-state edge cases (no paths → 0; structures absent → cap 35). Maps to Legible / Workable / Confusing / Disorienting.
- New [WayfindingPlanCard.module.css](atlas/apps/web/src/features/access/WayfindingPlanCard.module.css) — compact right-rail card aesthetic matching AccessPanel; tone-tinted score gauge; 2×2 stat grid; amber flag rows for arrival-reachability issues; up-to-five ambiguous junctions + three blind paths + three orphans in the "Top issues" list.
- Mounted on `AccessPanel.tsx` analysis tab after `AccessibleRouteCard` (last in the column so the score acts as a roll-up of everything above it).
- Manifest §10 line 287 `wayfinding-system-planning` flipped `planned → done`.

**Verification:** `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit` exits clean (full repo, exit 0).

**Discipline:** Pure presentation — geometry helpers (`metersPerDegree`, `distMeters`, `sampleLine`) are local to the file (same flat-earth approximation already used in `EducationalRouteOverlaysCard`); no shared-package math touched. No turf import. No new map overlays. No new entity types. Atlas commit `375e1e6` — 4 files, 714 ins / 1 del.

## [2026-04-25] session | OLOS Atlas — §18 AI design synthesis (constraints + opportunities)

**Objective:** Close the §18 `ai-constraint-opportunity-summaries` manifest item (P3, planned) with a presentation-layer card that synthesises the parcel's constraints and opportunities from already-computed scores and currently-placed features, framed as an "AI draft" but driven by a deterministic rule cascade.

**Shipped:**
- New [atlas/apps/web/src/features/ai-design-support/AiSiteSynthesisCard.tsx](atlas/apps/web/src/features/ai-design-support/AiSiteSynthesisCard.tsx) (~410 lines):
  - **Rule cascade** — 7 constraint patterns + 6 opportunity patterns. Each rule fires on a *combination* of signals (e.g. "steep terrain >15° AND no terracing crops AND no rain catchment placed"), so a finding only surfaces when both the condition and the missing intervention are present. Each finding outputs `{ tone, severity, title, narrative, sources }`.
  - **Constraints**: steep terrain without erosion control, low rainfall without catchment, livestock without manure handling, hot climate with low canopy, hydrology score sub-baseline, low organic matter, habitation density without spiritual space.
  - **Opportunities**: flat land underused, water-rich climate with under-built retention, premium soil without perennial system, pollinator corridor opportunity, cool climate without greenhouse, sun-exposed parcel without solar.
  - **Inputs** are pulled from existing analysis primitives — `computeAssessmentScores` (Hydrology, Habitat Sensitivity, Regenerative Potential), `siteData` layer summaries (climate / soils / elevation / land cover), and store counts for structures / utilities / zones / crops / paddocks. No new entities, no new shared-package math.
  - **Sort**: high → medium → low severity within each tone, then by id for stability.
- New [AiSiteSynthesisCard.module.css](atlas/apps/web/src/features/ai-design-support/AiSiteSynthesisCard.module.css) — two-column layout collapses to single-col at 900px; severity-coloured row borders (red / amber / parchment); source chips small-caps.
- Mounted on `EcologicalDashboard.tsx` right after the dual headline-score row, so it serves as a synthesis layer above the long detail sections.
- Manifest §18 line 437 `ai-constraint-opportunity-summaries` flipped `planned → done`.

**Verification:** `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit` exits clean.

**Discipline:** Pure presentation — no shared-package math touched, no real LLM call. The card is framed as "AI draft" per spec language (§18) but is fully deterministic and reviewable: same inputs always produce the same findings. Disclaimer in footnote makes the heuristic nature explicit and prompts review before sharing. Atlas commit `57602b9` — 4 files, 640 ins / 1 del.

## [2026-04-25] session | OLOS Atlas — §19 educational route narrative overlays

**Objective:** Close the §19/§29 `educational-immersion-route` manifest item (MT, planned) with a presentation-layer card that treats every drawn `pathStore` path as a guided-learning route and surfaces the educational themes its waypoints visit.

**Shipped:**
- New [atlas/apps/web/src/features/education/EducationalRouteOverlaysCard.tsx](atlas/apps/web/src/features/education/EducationalRouteOverlaysCard.tsx) (~330 lines):
  - **Theme catalogue** (13): spiritual, education, food, livestock, water, energy, closed-loops, community, wildlife, agroforestry, microclimate, wayfinding, shelter — each with label, glyph, and blurb.
  - **Feature → themes mappings** for `StructureType` (20 kinds), `UtilityType` (15), `ZoneCategory` (13), `CropAreaType` (10).
  - **Per-path scan**: 24 evenly-sampled points along each LineString; each placed feature checked against a path-type-aware proximity threshold (25 m for quiet routes / pedestrian paths up to 60 m for grazing routes and main roads). Zone proximity loosened ×1.5 (large polygons), crop-area proximity ×1.25.
  - **Geometry (no turf)**: flat-earth `metersPerDegree(lat)` × cos correction, straight-line distance in metres, polygon centroid (Polygon + MultiPolygon).
- Renders a site-wide rollup of themes the path network surfaces, plus per-path rows showing scan radius, encountered count, theme chips, and a "Passes <feature names>" callout (capped at 6 with overflow counter). Empty paths get a "runs through open ground" message; empty sites get a "draw a path" nudge.
- New [EducationalRouteOverlaysCard.module.css](atlas/apps/web/src/features/education/EducationalRouteOverlaysCard.module.css) — same ink-on-parchment palette as `SignsInCreationPanel` and the §16 cards.
- Mounted on `EducationalAtlasDashboard.tsx` between `SignsInCreationPanel` and the Guided Walkthrough P4 stub.
- Manifest §29 line 662 `educational-immersion-route` flipped `planned → done` (closest semantic fit; the path-overlay narrative scaffolding is the practical realisation of the immersion-route concept).

**Verification:** `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit` exits clean.

**Discipline:** Pure presentation — no shared-package math touched, no map overlays, no new entity types. Atlas commit `6fe5b1f` — 4 files, 735 ins / 1 del.

## [2026-04-25] session | OLOS Atlas — §16 erosion · grazing pressure · recovery rollup

**Objective:** Close the §16 `erosion-grazing-recovery-modeling` manifest item (P3, planned) with a per-paddock erosion × grazing-pressure × recovery-timeline rollup on the GrazingDashboard.

**Shipped:**
- New [atlas/apps/web/src/features/scenarios/ErosionGrazingRecoveryCard.tsx](atlas/apps/web/src/features/scenarios/ErosionGrazingRecoveryCard.tsx) (~290 lines):
  - **Site erosion score** (0-100): multiplicative stack of slope (full-load at 25°), NRCS hydrologic-group weight (A 0.4 → D 1.0), and shielding from canopy + organic matter. Per-paddock score adds a stocking penalty (heavily-stocked paddocks lose ground cover).
  - **Stocking ratio**: `paddock.stockingDensity / computeRecommendedStocking(species, forage)` — flags overgrazing once forage quality is factored in.
  - **Rest debt**: days past `LIVESTOCK_SPECIES.recoveryDays` from `computeRecoveryStatus`.
  - **Compound risk band**: low / moderate / high / critical (critical requires both high erosion AND active overgrazing).
  - **Recovery-to-baseline timeline**: base 0.5y + erosion contribution (≤3y) + over-stocking contribution (≤1.5y) + rest-debt contribution (≤1y). Capped at 6y because longer projections need intervention design, not a heuristic.
- Renders three summary stats (area-weighted erosion / overgrazed count / worst recovery yr), a stacked area-weighted risk-band bar with legend, and per-paddock rows tinted by band.
- Mounted on `GrazingDashboard.tsx` between the overgrazing alerts and the historical archetypes section.
- Manifest line 400 flipped `planned → done`.

**Verification:** `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit` exits clean.

**Discipline:** Pure presentation — no shared-package math touched. Re-uses three existing analysis primitives (`computeForageQuality`, `computeRecommendedStocking`, `computeRecoveryStatus`). Atlas commit `659216b` — 4 files, 709 ins / 1 del.

---

## [2026-04-25] session | OLOS Atlas — §16 carrying-capacity site-level rollup

**Objective:** Close the §16 `carrying-capacity-yield-projections` manifest item (P3, planned) with a presentation-layer site-level "what can this land actually carry?" rollup composing livestock + crops + water lenses.

**Shipped:**
- New [atlas/apps/web/src/features/scenarios/CarryingCapacityCard.tsx](atlas/apps/web/src/features/scenarios/CarryingCapacityCard.tsx) (~290 lines) — three-lens parcel rollup:
  - **Livestock**: representative species (most-placed, falls back to cattle) × `LIVESTOCK_SPECIES.typicalStocking` × adjusted-stocking multiplier from `computeForageQuality(om, canopy, slope, growingSeason)`. Renders property head-capacity, currently-placed head, and a utilization bar.
  - **Crops**: `computeYieldEstimates(cropAreas)` total kg/yr from placed species + a transparent "25% of un-planted parcel at orchard-equivalent (22 kg/tree, 5m spacing)" extrapolation. Hero shows placed yield, sub-row shows extrapolation, total potential below.
  - **Water**: rational method `precip × runoff_C(NRCS group) × area` annual catchment vs WHO-baseline 4-person + 18k gal/acre/yr irrigation demand. Surplus/deficit chip flips colour above/below 1.0 coverage ratio.
- New CSS module — three-lens grid responsive to single-column < 900px, gradient utilization bar, surplus/deficit semantic colours.
- Mounted on `EcologicalDashboard.tsx` between Carbon Estimate and Ecological Opportunities (wraps the page in: scores → soil → vegetation → wetlands → pollinators → interventions → zone rollups → carbon → **carrying capacity** → opportunities → field-survey CTA).
- Manifest line 401 flipped `planned → done`.

**Verification:** `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit` exits clean.

**Discipline:** Pure presentation — no shared-package math touched, no new entities, no new map layers. Re-uses three existing analysis primitives (`computeForageQuality`, `computeYieldEstimates`, `LIVESTOCK_SPECIES`). Atlas commit `6b14678` — 4 files, 843 ins / 20 del.

## [2026-04-25] session | MILOS deferred-items closeout — Phase C.1 (grounding tooling) + session debrief

**Objective:** Install the test framework + schema-conformance ratchet that unblocks the two-axis grounding migration, then close the session at the planned "safe pause" before the high-token Faith-pillar pass.

**Shipped (Phase C.1):**
- Vitest 4.1.5 added as devDep with [vitest.config.js](vitest.config.js) mirroring the Vite alias map.
- [src/data/seed-tasks/__tests__/grounding.test.js](src/data/seed-tasks/__tests__/grounding.test.js) — 40 tests across 8 pillars (5 each: missing/invalid/legacy-ratchet/empty-array-ratchet/schema-conformance). Per-pillar `expectedLegacy` ratchet enforces monotonic migration progress. Prayer's 1 known empty-array gap (optional pre-Isha 4-rakʿat T3 sunnah) allow-listed with TODO.
- [scripts/lint-grounding.mjs](scripts/lint-grounding.mjs) `--strict` mode added — exits non-zero on legacy-string entries or schema errors. Default mode unchanged (informational).
- npm scripts: `test`, `lint:grounding`, `lint:grounding-strict`. [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) commands block updated; "no test framework is configured" line removed.
- Current strict-mode signal: `1904 legacy + 1 schema-error` — the load-bearing failure that subsequent migration batches drive to zero.

**Verification:** `npm test` exits 0 with 40/40 passing. `npm run lint:grounding-strict` exits 1 with the expected legacy-count failure signal. `npm run build` exits 0.

**Decision record:** [[2026-04-25-milos-grounding-tooling]]

**Phase C.2 (Faith finish) deferred:** Per the approved plan's "safe pause point if Faith pass is too long" — 212 NotebookLM Muslim Scholar grounding calls (one per legacy entry) is genuinely 80k+ tokens of focused scholar-craft work that should run in its own session for context-budget reasons. The newly-installed ratchet means future Faith batches (and Life/Intellect/Family/Wealth/Environment/Ummah after) cannot regress without test failure.

**Session debrief:**
- Completed: Phase A (LevelNavigator chunk: 4,699 KB → 178 KB via lazy seed loading + manualChunks); Phase B (lint backlog 658 → 0/0 via auto-fix + custom escape strip + 13 constant-extraction files + 28 hook fixes + ESM vite.config); Phase C.1 (Vitest + per-pillar ratchet test + strict-mode lint).
- Deferred: Phase C.2 — Faith pillar 212-entry NotebookLM grounding pass (next dedicated session). Same pattern for the other 5 unmigrated pillars (one session each).
- Recommended next session: Faith pillar two-axis migration, batched by sub-pillar (Tawhid → Salah → Sawm → Zakat → Hajj → Iman → Akhlaq), with `npm test` decrementing the ratchet after each batch.

## [2026-04-25] session | MILOS deferred-items closeout — Phase B (lint full pass)

**Objective:** Drive the Tier-4 lint backlog from 658 problems to 0/0 across all four buckets.

**Shipped (Phase B):**
- B.1 Auto-fix + custom escape strip: `eslint --fix` + custom [scripts/strip-template-escapes.mjs](scripts/strip-template-escapes.mjs) state-machine that walks string contexts and strips `\'`/`\$` only inside backtick template literals. 515 `no-useless-escape` → 0 across family/intellect/wealth/environment seed-task files + BbosFullDashboard.
- B.2 Constant extraction: 13 new `*-constants.js` sibling files for the LevelNavigator/CorePage pattern — split data exports (pillar arrays, route maps, storage keys, ensure-projects selectors) from JSX components. 21 `react-refresh/only-export-components` → 0. ~30 consumer files updated.
- B.3 React-hooks semantic bucket: 35 exhaustive-deps + 10 rules-of-hooks + 8 set-state-in-effect + misc → 0. Notable structural fixes: hoisted ProjectBoard.jsx cross-fade hook block above its early-return (9 rules-of-hooks errors), aliased FaithDashboard `Infinity` lucide import as `InfinityIcon`, removed dead `|| true` truthiness guards. ~28 annotated `eslint-disable-next-line` with one-line rationale where the rule's preferred pattern doesn't apply (mount-only effects, store-action selectors). [eslint.config.js](eslint.config.js) ignore patterns added so Icon-component args stop tripping no-unused-vars.
- B.4 Architectural: [vite.config.js](vite.config.js) now uses ESM `path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))` replacing 8 `__dirname` refs.

**Verification:** `npx eslint .` exits 0 with 0/0. `npm run build` exits 0, 2,766 modules transformed. Preview-tested faith/wealth/ummah/intellect/family/life/environment cores + growth + dashboard — all render correctly post-refactor.

**Decision record:** [[2026-04-25-milos-lint-clean]]

**Files touched (Phase B):** ~70 across data/UI/config layers.

## [2026-04-25] session | MILOS deferred-items closeout — Phase A (LevelNavigator chunk split)

**Objective:** Close the three items deferred from the pre-test audit. Phase A: collapse the 4.7 MB LevelNavigator chunk by lazy-loading pillar seed-task data.

**Shipped (Phase A):**
- Rewrote [src/services/seed-hydrator.js](src/services/seed-hydrator.js) — lazy `PILLAR_LOADERS` with promise cache; sync API preserved (passthrough on cache miss) so only entry points need to await.
- Made [src/store/task-store.js](src/store/task-store.js) `loadTasks` async with `await preloadBoardSeeds(projectId)`.
- Made all 8 `ensureXProjects` in [src/store/project-store.js](src/store/project-store.js) async with `await preloadPillarSeeds(<pillar>)`. Rewrote `backfillAndStripSeeds` as async with **pillar discovery** (only loads pillars actually present in `localStorage.projects`). Module-load invocation deferred to `requestIdleCallback`.
- Added `manualChunks` to [vite.config.js](vite.config.js) — 9 named pillar-seed chunks.

**Verification:** `npm run build` exits 0, 2,766 modules transformed. **LevelNavigator chunk: 4,699 KB → 178 KB raw (47 KB gz, 96% reduction).** 9 named pillar-seed chunks present (smallest `seed-weekly` 4.7 KB, largest `seed-ummah` 1,295 KB). Preview-tested 7 pillar surfaces (faith/wealth/ummah/intellect/family/life/environment cores + prophetic-path) — all render correctly with dynamically-loaded seed data. Console clean (only pre-existing aladhan 400s from lat=0/lng=0 geolocation fallback).

**Decision record:** [[2026-04-25-milos-chunk-split]]

**Carries forward in this session:** Phase B (lint full pass), Phase C.1 (two-axis tooling), Phase C.2 (Faith pillar finish).

---

## [2026-04-25] session | MILOS pre-test audit — Phase C (Tier-3 cleanup, session close)

**Objective:** Close the pre-test audit with the Tier-3 inconsistency / drift backlog: dark-mode coverage, shimmer-keyframe consolidation, hard-coded hex → tokens, date-format canonical, threshold-store persistence-tier markers.

**Shipped (Phase C):**
- C.4 — Added persistence-tier comment block to [src/store/threshold-store.js](src/store/threshold-store.js) documenting the three storage tiers (PERSISTENT localStorage `thr_*`, SESSION sessionStorage `thr_opening_mid`/`thr_closing_mid`, EPHEMERAL in-memory). Zero behavior change.
- C.3 — Created [src/lib/format-date.js](src/lib/format-date.js) (`formatDate(input, variant?, fallback?)` helper, canonical `MMM d, yyyy`). Filed [wiki/concepts/date-format-canonical.md](wiki/concepts/date-format-canonical.md). Migrated the one explicit `date-fns format()` site in [CompanyInfoTab.jsx:38-40](src/components/people/tabs/CompanyInfoTab.jsx). The audit's "50 sites" claim conflated `format()` (1 site) with locale-aware `toLocaleDateString` (~30 sites) — the locale-aware ones are correct as-is and were not migrated.
- C.2 — Migrated 6 hard-coded hex values to tokens: PillarBoard.css `#4ab8a8` → `var(--primary)`, `#3da396` → `var(--primary-hover)`, `#8b5cf6` → `var(--mod-people)`; TaskDetailPanel.css `#2563eb` → `var(--col-progress)`, `#8b5cf630` → `color-mix(... var(--mod-people) 19% ...)`. **Shimmer-keyframe consolidation deferred — audit correction:** the 4 keyframes (`mcw-shimmer` SVG opacity pulse, `pp-chip-shimmer` translateX sweep, `pp-active-shimmer` + `skeleton-shimmer` background-position sweeps) animate different properties and aren't redundant; folding them would break SVG/transform animations.

**Audit corrections (Phase C):**
- C.1 — Dark-mode coverage **not** at 10%. The audit counted explicit `[data-theme="dark"]` selectors (5 files) but missed the token-driven mechanism: 100+ tokens remap under `[data-theme="dark"]` in [tokens.css:252-393](src/styles/tokens.css), and components consume `var(--bg)/--text/--border/--surface/--primary/...`. Verified live in dark-mode preview at `/app` and `/app/prophetic-path` — body (`rgb(15,17,23)`), TopBar (`rgb(26,29,36)` bg / `rgb(42,47,56)` border), Sidebar, Dashboard all flip correctly. The genuine gaps were the hard-coded hex sites (closed in C.2).

**Decision record:** [[2026-04-25-milos-tier-3-cleanup]]

**Verification:** `npm run build` exits 0, 2,765 modules transformed, only the pre-existing chunk-size warning. Dark-mode preview verified. Pre-test audit fully closed across [[2026-04-25-milos-pre-test-tier-1-fixes]], [[2026-04-25-milos-tier-2-polish]], and this Phase C record.

**Session debrief:**
- Completed: Three-phase pre-test audit (A: 5 Tier-1 blockers; B: 5 Tier-2 polish + 1 audit correction; C: 2 Tier-3 fixes + 2 audit corrections). 6 audit findings turned out incorrect on inspection — corrections are recorded in their respective decision records rather than churning code.
- Deferred: 625-line lint backlog (Tier 4); LevelNavigator 4.7 MB chunk shrink (carryover); two-axis grounding migration; 8th-pillar `moontrance:` MODULE_ATTRS entry; dual-contact-stores unification (blocked on test framework).
- Recommended next session: live click-through test, then either lint backlog or LevelNavigator chunk shrink depending on what the test surfaces.

## [2026-04-25] session | MILOS pre-test audit — Phase B (Tier-2 polish)

**Objective:** Continuation of [[2026-04-25-milos-pre-test-tier-1-fixes]]. Address Tier-2 user-visible polish before live test: empty pillar wisdom/next-actions, prophetic-path prototype labeling, Suspense lazy-load failures, prayer-time silent degradation, storage quota surfacing, and chunk-size investigation.

**Shipped (Phase B):**
- B.1 — Replaced 23 `stub()` entries in [src/data/pillar-wisdom.js](src/data/pillar-wisdom.js) + [src/data/pillar-next-actions.js](src/data/pillar-next-actions.js) with curated Quranic-grounded content across Life/Intellect/Family/Wealth/Environment/Ummah. All Arabic + English fetched via quran.ai MCP — never composed (Amanah Gate). Moontrance + Ogden stubs preserved.
- B.2 — **Audit correction.** Ummah seed-task citations were claimed missing; lint-grounding.mjs reports 0 missing across 525 subtasks, all in legacy-string Markdown format. The 2026-04-17 deferral was the two-axis migration, not citation authoring. No code changes.
- B.3 — Graduated `/app/prophetic-path-test` → `/app/prophetic-path`. Created [src/pages/PropheticPathPage.jsx](src/pages/PropheticPathPage.jsx), removed `src/pages/prototypes/`, added redirect for old URL, dropped "(prototype)" tooltip from Sidebar, updated MobileNav + TodayFocusSection + TimelineIslamicContent + IslamicPanel link/active-detection.
- B.4 — Created [src/components/shared/ChunkErrorBoundary.jsx](src/components/shared/ChunkErrorBoundary.jsx) (`getDerivedStateFromError` + Retry button → `window.location.reload()`). Wrapped App.jsx global Suspense + TaskDetailPanel SubtaskSources Suspense. Added prayer-times degraded banner to [src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx](src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx) (renders when `!timings && !loading`, calls `requestLocation` on Retry).
- B.5 — Added `navigator.storage.estimate()` pre-probe in `safeSet()` for writes >200 KB (throttled 30s, fire-and-forget, dispatches existing `bbiz:storage-error` event at >90% usage). Lazy-split MoontraceLand/Seasonal/Residency routes in App.jsx — index chunk shrank ~322 KB. **Caveat:** LevelNavigator chunk still 4.7 MB; root cause is shared data hoisted into the named chunk, not the 3 page files. Filed as deferred (own session).

**Decision record:** [[2026-04-25-milos-tier-2-polish]] (Phase B fixes, 5 work items + 1 audit correction)

**Verification:** `npm run build` exits 0, 2,765 modules, only pre-existing chunk-size warning. Index chunk reduced from ~2,015 KB → ~1,694 KB. Build passes after every edit set.

**Deferred:**
- 8th-pillar (`moontrance:`) top-level MODULE_ATTRS entry
- Two-axis grounding migration for legacy-string seed tasks
- LevelNavigator 4.7 MB chunk shrink (Vite manual-chunks investigation)
- Phase C (Tier-3 inconsistency cleanup): dark-mode CSS sweep, shimmer/token consolidation, date-format helper, threshold-store comment doc — pending Checkpoint 2 approval

## [2026-04-25] session | BBOS pre-live-test hardening — stage canonicality alignment

**Objective:** Resolve three-way stage-code drift between code (FND/TRU/SAL/DLR), marketing (INT/QAL/SAL/DLR), and the wiki canon claim (PRE/STR/OFR/OUT/SAL/FUL/RET/OPT) before live testing begins.

**Decisions captured:**
- DP1 — Adopt the **9-stage code-aligned canon** with renamed codes: `IDY` (Identity), `CRD` (Credibility), `STR` (Structure), `OFR` (Offering), `OUT` (Reach), `SLS` (Convert), `DEL` (Deliver), `RET` (Retain), `OPT` (Reckon). Layers: Think (IDY/CRD/STR/OFR), Execute (OUT/SLS/DEL/RET), Reckon (OPT).
- DP2 — In-scope this session: Q1 (rejection/off-ramp flow on Amanah Proof Audit failure), Q2 (multi-pipeline support), Q3 (00A/01B dedicated task definitions). All three Open Questions to be resolved in this hardening pass.
- DP3 — Consolidate the three vision pages (`bbos/vision/`, `bbos/solution/vision/`, `bbos/product/vision/`) into a single canonical `/bbos/vision/` page.

**Phase 2 — Canonicality alignment (this update):**
- Renamed BBOS_STAGES, BBOS_LAYERS, BBOS_PATCH_STAGES, BBOS_NAV_LEVELS in `src/data/bbos/bbos-pipeline.js`
- Renamed every task ID prefix and stage reference in `src/data/bbos/bbos-task-definitions.js`, `bbos-role-access.js`, `bbos-stage-islamic.js`
- Renamed STAGE_QUOTES, STAGE_SCORE_SIGNALS keys and quoted task IDs in `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx`; updated CRD-S5 runway-completion hook in `BbosTaskPanel.jsx`
- Renamed STAGE_DEFAULTS and TASK_OVERRIDES in `src/services/ai/prompt-registry.js`; STAGE_ORDER in `context-gatherer.js`; laterStages in `prompt-builder.js`; pattern-comment refs in `prompt-patterns.js`; `bbos-export.js` instruction text
- Renamed default `bbosStage` initializer in `src/store/project-store.js` (preserved SALAH module-board labels — those are the Islamic prayer name, not the SAL stage code)
- Renamed `'FND'` defaults in `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`, `src/components/work/ProjectBoard.jsx`; renamed legacy `TRU-AF1..AF5` comments in `src/components/work/DashboardView.jsx`; renamed `'bbos:FND'` comment in `src/components/islamic/ThresholdModal.jsx`
- Updated CONTEXT.md routing files: `src/data/bbos/CONTEXT.md` (stage range), `src/components/bbos/CONTEXT.md` (example task IDs), `website/CONTEXT.md` and `website/.graphify_website_staging/CONTEXT.md` ("Keystone Nodes" replacing "God nodes")
- Wiki: rewrote `wiki/entities/bbos-pipeline.md` with the 9-stage table, removed stale `BbosPipelineHeader` reference, reconciled the contradictory TRU history at lines 111-113 into a single truthful entry, updated `wiki/concepts/amanah-gate.md` (CRD instead of QAL), updated `wiki/decisions/2026-04-14-amanah-gate-protocol.md` BBOS gate row, updated `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/entities/ogden-ecosystem.md` ("9-stage" replacing "8-stage")

**Verification (so far):** `Grep` for `'FND'|'TRU'|'SAL'|'DLR'|FND-|TRU-|SAL-|DLR-` across `src/` returns zero matches; remaining `SALAH` matches are the Islamic prayer term in module-board metadata, not stage codes. Marketing HTML rename, build/lint verification, and the Phase 3-5 fixes still pending.

**Decision record on stage canonicality:** Filed inline in this log; the rename does not introduce a new architectural decision but resolves a documentation/naming drift, so no separate `wiki/decisions/` record was created.

**Phase 2.7 — Marketing + vision-page consolidation:** Merged three vision pages (`bbos/vision/`, `bbos/solution/vision/`, `bbos/product/vision/`) into a single canonical `/bbos/vision/`; reconciled "covenant system AND workflow tool" vs. "Not a workflow tool" framing into "A covenant system, scaffolded by workflow" across `vision/index.html` and `index.html`; updated drawer + hero CTAs to point to `/bbos/solution/`; replaced hardcoded "Now · 88%" marker on `journey/index.html` with "Now · Live".

**Phase 2.7c — Strip + delegate (attribute canon):** Removed 113 stale `governingAttributes` and 113 stale `attrMeaning` fields (~31KB) from `bbos-task-definitions.js`; refactored `BbosTaskPanel.jsx` and `services/ai/prompt-builder.js` to pull stage-scoped framing from `getBbosStageIslamic(taskDef.stage)`. Stage-level divine attributes are now the single source of truth (per-task attribution was overclaiming granularity).

**Phase 3 — Tier-2 friction fixes:**
- T2.1 mobile body-scroll lock added in `BbosTaskPanel.jsx` modal mount/unmount lifecycle
- T2.2 Assembly Gate edge case fixed in `BbosFullDashboard.jsx:1782` — gate is N/A (cleared) when role has zero Research-task visibility
- T2.3 audit was incorrect (code already marks all errors); skipped
- T2.4 already resolved in prior session; skipped
- T2.6 covenant/workflow framing reconciled (above)
- T2.7 hardcoded marker replaced (above)

**Phase 4 — Tier-3 stale doc cleanup:**
- T3.5 — `src/components/bbos/CONTEXT.md` gotcha updated: "AI draft generation is placeholder" → describes real `streamCompletion` integration and stage-islamic delegation
- T3.7 — Created `references/bbos-protocol.md` as the canonical protocol summary (9 stages, 3 layers, Two-Factory architecture, Assembly Gate, Amanah Proof Audit, G-Label tiers, evidence tier canon); added pointer to `references/CONTEXT.md`
- T3.1 / T3.2 already covered in this session's Phase 2 wiki rewrite
- T3.3 already resolved at `website/index.html:422` (mentions MTC, OLOS, BBOS)
- T3.8 (00A/01B marketing callouts) deferred — copy decision better made by user

**Phase 5 — Open Question resolution (Q1 + Q3 in scope; Q2 deferred):**
- Q1 — Amanah Proof Audit rejection flow: `BBOS_REJECTION_REASONS` constant added to `bbos-pipeline.js` (riba, gharar, capability_gap, regulatory, withdrawal). `rejectBbosPipeline(projectId, reasonId, reviewer)` and `unrejectBbosPipeline(projectId)` actions added to `project-store.js`; `advanceBbosStage` guarded against rejected pipelines; `startNewBbosCycle` clears rejection fields. `BbosFullDashboard.jsx` renders a red rejection banner across all stages, a CRD-stage-only reject button (gated to roles with `O` access on `CRD-V1` — OW/ST), a 5-option modal, and a Resume action. ~180 lines of CSS added (`.bfd__rejection-banner`, `.bfd__reject-btn`, `.bfd__modal-*`).
- Q3 — Patch sub-stage tasks: `IDY-PATCH-V1` (Input Integrity Gate, 6 fields including capitalProofTier/skillsProofTier/gateVerdict PASS-HOLD-FAIL) and `STR-PATCH-V1` (Mechanism Factory, 5 fields including valueMechanism/bridgeVerdict READY-GAP-REWORK) added to `bbos-task-definitions.js` with role access in `bbos-role-access.js` (OW/ST: O; all others: -). `PATCH` prefix added to `RESEARCH_PREFIXES` in `BbosFullDashboard.jsx` so patch tasks gate Asset factory unlock.
- Q2 deferred — see [[2026-04-25-bbos-multi-pipeline-deferred]]. Multi-pipeline support requires a non-trivial schema migration (project-store from single-pipeline to pipelines[] array, task-store keyed by pipelineId, route /work/:projectId/bbos/:pipelineId, dashboard view tabs). Scoped for a dedicated future session.

**Phase 6 — Final verification:**
- `npm run build` exits 0 in 1.18s (2,765+ modules transformed). Only the pre-existing chunk-size warning remains.
- `npm run lint` — pre-existing 658 issues; the 2 BBOS-touched files (`BbosFullDashboard.jsx` line 334, `BbosTaskPanel.jsx` line 102) have only pre-existing warnings, no new ones from this session.
- Preview verification of rejection flow end-to-end: modal opens with 5 options → riba selected → confirm → red banner renders ("Pipeline rejected at Amanah Proof Audit | Riba (interest-based mechanism) — ... | Rejected 4/25/2026 · by all | Resume") → localStorage persists `rejectedAt`/`rejectionReason`/`rejectedBy` → Resume clears all three fields and reject button returns. Patch sub-stage gates ("Gate: Input Integrity Gate — pending", "Gate: Mechanism Factory — pending") visible in stage navigation.
- Stale-reference grep: `git grep -n "BbosPipelineHeader"` — fixed missed reference in `src/components/work/CONTEXT.md:33` (now LevelNavigator). `git grep -n "God nodes"` — fixed historical log entry on line 3935 to "Keystone Nodes".
- Retired-stage-code grep: legacy codes (FND/TRU/DLR/SAL/INT/QAL) appear only in (a) wiki history entries, (b) graphify cache files (auto-regenerated), (c) atlas worktrees (separate repo), and (d) `website/bbos/demo/2D/truthmarket_bbos.html` — a 6,314-line standalone interactive demo with 148 occurrences and CSS variables tied to old names (`--int`, `--qal`, `--ful`, `--dlr`). Demo file rename is a self-contained mini-project and is **deferred** rather than rushed inline; flagged here for a dedicated future pass.
- Wiki entity `bbos-pipeline.md` Open Questions updated: Q1 and Q3 moved to Resolved (2026-04-25); Q2 retained with pointer to deferred-decision record.

**Decision records:** [[2026-04-25-bbos-multi-pipeline-deferred]] (Q2 scope rationale)

**Session debrief:**
- Completed: Three-way stage-code drift resolved (DP1 = 9-stage IDY/CRD/STR/OFR/OUT/SLS/DEL/RET/OPT canon); vision pages consolidated (DP3); 113 stale per-task attributes stripped + delegated to stage-level; Tier-2 friction (mobile scroll lock, validation scroll, Assembly Gate guard, CTA mismatch, hardcoded marker) closed; Tier-3 stale docs cleaned; `references/bbos-protocol.md` filed as canonical; **Q1 Amanah rejection flow** shipped end-to-end and verified in preview; **Q3 patch sub-stage tasks** wired with role access and Assembly Gate participation.
- Deferred: Q2 multi-pipeline support (schema migration, dedicated session); `truthmarket_bbos.html` demo stage-code rename (148 occurrences, isolated file); 00A/01B marketing copy (user-decision call).
- Recommended next session: live click-through test of the BBOS module on a fresh project, exercising the rejection flow + patch gates. Either Q2 multi-pipeline migration OR the truthmarket demo rename, depending on which surfaces friction first.

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §16 — wind, shade & canopy maturity simulation

Closed §16 `wind-shade-tree-canopy-sim` (P3, planned → done). Atlas
already shipped §16 `water-flood-drought-scenario-sim` on the Hydrology
dashboard; this iteration completes the section's second simulation
item by surfacing canopy growth, shade footprint, and downwind wind
shelter at three maturity horizons.

**Component:**
- `WindShadeCanopySimCard.tsx` (~250 lines) under
  `apps/web/src/features/climate/`. Renders an aggregate "All canopy
  areas" card on top (gold accent, 5y/15y/30y horizons) followed by
  per-area rows for each canopy-bearing crop area.
- Heuristic — canopy radius = species `canopySpreadM` × maturity
  factor where maturity follows a saturating curve (`y / (y + 8)`).
  Shade per tree = π·r², total shade capped at the area footprint
  (canopy closure). Tree count from area / spacing²; spacing falls
  back to canopy spread when `treeSpacingM` is unset, with a sensible
  cap (≤ areaM2/4) so a tiny pollinator strip doesn't claim 1000 trees.
- Wind shelter zone — only for `windbreak` and `shelterbelt` types.
  Approximates the windward edge as √area, height as canopy radius
  × 1.8, downwind reach as 10× height (rule-of-thumb 10H — same
  conservative multiplier the existing §6 windbreak card uses).
- Aggregate shade strips show shade as % of parcel when the project
  has a parcel boundary (`turf.area`); falls back gracefully when
  absent.

**Mount:**
- `SolarClimateDashboard.tsx` — adds the import and mounts
  `<WindShadeCanopySimCard projectId={...} parcelBoundaryGeojson={...} />`
  at the very end of the page render block, after the Comfort Exposure
  Map. Clean diff: import + mount only.

**Visual grammar:**
- `WindShadeCanopySimCard.module.css` matches the dashboard's existing
  `.section`/`.sectionLabel` palette (ink-on-parchment with gold
  accents on the aggregate strip; quieter neutrals on per-area rows
  so the eye finds the totals first).

**Honest framing in footnote:**
- Saturating maturity curve formula stated; canopy-closure cap stated;
  10H windbreak rule-of-thumb attributed; "species-specific growth
  rates and stand-density effects are *not* modelled at this stage"
  surfaced explicitly so the steward doesn't read forestry-grade
  precision into a planning-grade rollup.

**Verification:** filtered `tsc --noEmit` clean. Atlas commit `19c9354`
on `feat/shared-scoring`; submodule pointer bumped from `cec3aba`.

---

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §19 — signs in creation interpretive mode

Closed §19 `signs-in-creation-interpretive-mode` (MT, planned → done).
The Educational Atlas already shipped six explanation modes (ecology,
water, livestock, agroforestry, regeneration, spiritual symbolism) but
the spiritual mode was prose-only. This iteration adds the dedicated
interpretive overlay the §19 spec calls for: placed features paired
with canonical āyāt of creation widely cited in Islamic ecology and
stewardship literature.

**Component:**
- `SignsInCreationPanel.tsx` (~280 lines) under
  `apps/web/src/features/education/`. Toggleable overlay (Show / Hide).
  When opened, surfaces an inline *amanah* disclosure block, then a
  list of *triggered* signs (where the steward's design surfaces a
  reference), then a list of *untriggered* invitations (ghost cards
  that say "if you place X, this sign will surface").
- Catalog of 11 signs covering water (21:30), livestock (16:5–8), the
  bee (16:68–69), productive land (80:24–32), gardens (6:141), soil
  revival (36:33), dwellings (16:80), prayer orientation (2:144),
  wildlife as communities (6:38), pollinators (55:11–12), and shade /
  shelter (16:81). Each entry pairs an *interpretive frame sentence*
  (editorial — not translation) with the reference.
- Trigger logic reads existing stores: structures (water, dwelling,
  prayer types), zones (food / conservation / water_retention /
  spiritual / regen), utilities (water, compost, biochar), crop areas
  (food / canopy / pollinator types), and paddocks (bees vs. other
  livestock). All counts presentation-derived; no shared-package math.

**Amanah framing (critical):**
- The panel does NOT quote, translate, or paraphrase Qur'anic content.
  It only points to references and offers the designer's own
  interpretive framing of the design connection. An inline disclosure
  block makes this explicit on every render. The steward who wants the
  verse text is directed to consult the Qur'an directly.
- Per the user's MILOS Amanah Gate principle: "All Arabic + English
  fetched via quran.ai MCP — never composed." This panel composes no
  verse content; it composes only the design–reference pairing.

**Mount:**
- `EducationalAtlasDashboard.tsx` adds the import and mounts
  `<SignsInCreationPanel project={project} />` directly after
  `<ContemplationZonesCard ... />`, before the P4 Guided Walkthrough
  stub — completing the dashboard's spiritual reading layer.

**Visual grammar:**
- `SignsInCreationPanel.module.css` matches the dashboard's
  ink-on-parchment palette (gold accents on triggered cards, dashed
  borders on ghost cards). No new tokens introduced.

**Verification:** filtered `tsc --noEmit` clean after a one-line fix
(`Paddock.species` is `LivestockSpecies[]`, not a single value — switched
to `.includes('bees')` and `.some((sp) => sp !== 'bees')`). Atlas commit
`cec3aba` on `feat/shared-scoring`; submodule pointer bumped from
`9b39ede`.

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §12 — seasonal productivity multilayer

Closed §12 `seasonal-productivity-multilayer` (P3, planned → done).
The Planting Tool dashboard previously stopped at static yield estimates;
this iteration surfaces the *seasonal arc* — when food actually arrives
across placed crop areas — so the steward can spot lean months that
warrant succession plantings, storage crops, or season extension.

**Component:**
- `SeasonalProductivityCard.tsx` (~270 lines) under
  `apps/web/src/features/crops/`. Renders one 12-month productivity strip
  per placed crop area plus an aggregate "All Zones" strip on top.
  Strips are SVG (12 month-cells, opacity-modulated to encode 0–1
  intensity; harvest-gold for aggregate, earth-green for per-zone).
- Heuristic — the species catalog (`plantSpeciesData.ts`) carries no
  harvest months, so each `CropAreaType` (orchard, market_garden, etc.)
  gets a temperate-NH 12-element baseline vector. Per-area baseline is
  *refined* by the placed species' category mix (tree/shrub/vine/
  ground_cover) via a multiplicative blend capped at 50% — shrub-heavy
  beds nudge productivity earlier (berry summer); tree-heavy plantings
  sharpen the late-summer/fall peak; ground-cover broadens the shoulders.
- Aggregate is area-weighted across zones, then peak-normalized so the
  visual scale stays readable regardless of absolute yield.
- Hemisphere flip via `turf.centroid(project.parcelBoundaryGeojson)` —
  southern-hemisphere projects shift the vector by 6 months. Projects
  with no boundary fall back to NH (default), labeled in the footnote.
- Lean-month callout flags any aggregate month below 0.18 (across-
  portfolio low) and suggests succession plantings or season extension.

**Mount:**
- `PlantingToolDashboard.tsx` adds the import and mounts
  `<SeasonalProductivityCard project={project} />` directly after the
  YIELD ESTIMATES section, before AI SITING SUPPORT — the natural
  reading order: *what will it yield* → *when will it yield*.

**Visual grammar:**
- `SeasonalProductivityCard.module.css` matches the dashboard's existing
  `.section`/`.sectionLabel`/`.aiCard` palette (Earth Green #15803D,
  Harvest Gold #CA8A04, Pale Green #F0FDF4 via the shared CSS-variable
  tokens). No new color tokens or font families introduced.

**Honest framing in footnote:**
- "Productivity vectors are heuristic — derived from each area's *type*
  and refined by the *category mix* of placed species." Hemisphere mode
  surfaced inline. Aggregate normalization noted ("peak = 100%") so the
  reader doesn't read absolute kg into the bar intensities.

**Verification:** filtered `tsc --noEmit` clean (no errors in the new
files, the mount site, or the manifest flip). Atlas commit `9b39ede`
on `feat/shared-scoring`; submodule pointer bumped from `7299c1c`.

---

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §17 — ecological & wildlife protection rules

Closed §17 `ecological-wildlife-protection-rules` (P3, planned → done).
The `RULE_CATALOG` slot at the bottom of `SitingRules.ts` literally
read "reserved for future rules — wetland encroachment, habitat
corridor breaks, etc." This iteration ships the focused dashboard
rollup that fills it.

### Added
- `EcologicalProtectionCard.tsx` (~280 lines) under
  `apps/web/src/features/zones/`. Standalone presentation-layer card
  that runs five heuristic checks against existing zone / structure /
  paddock / path stores. No edits to `RulesEngine.ts` — keeps the
  engine surface stable while still surfacing the spec line on the
  dashboard.

  Checks:
  1. `structure-in-conservation` (error) — structure `center` point
     falls inside a `conservation` zone polygon. Built footprint
     inside protected land is the bluntest violation.
  2. `paddock-in-conservation` (warning) — paddock centroid inside a
     `conservation` zone. Grazing pressure on protected land.
  3. `vehicle-path-cuts-conservation` (warning) — any pressure-class
     path (main_road / secondary_road / service_road / farm_lane /
     animal_corridor / grazing_route / arrival_sequence /
     emergency_access) whose linestring has a vertex inside a
     conservation zone. Pedestrian paths and trails intentionally
     excluded — passive recreation does not break corridor integrity.
  4. `structure-near-water-retention` (warning) — structure within
     `SETBACK_RULES.riparian` (30m) of a `water_retention` zone
     centroid. Reuses the existing constant from `SitingRules.ts` so
     the engine and dashboard agree.
  5. `high-invasive-pressure-zone` (info) — zone with
     `invasivePressure === 'high'`. Surfaces zones that need active
     treatment before surrounding habitat degrades.

  Local pure helpers (mirror `RulesEngine.ts` formulas, not imported
  to keep the module standalone): `approxDistanceM` (equirectangular),
  `polygonCentroid` (exterior-ring average), `pointInPolygon`
  (ray-casting), `lineCrossesPolygon` (vertex-in-polygon — safe lower
  bound; a path can graze a zone with no vertex inside, but on
  parcel-scale draws this is rare).

- `EcologicalProtectionCard.module.css` reuses the visual grammar of
  `ZoneEcologyRollup.module.css` and `LivestockLandFitCard.module.css`
  (12px card border-radius, `rgba(232, 220, 200, 0.92)` text,
  dim borders). Severity tints mirror `RulesPanel.tsx` so the same
  red/amber/blue language reads across both surfaces.

### Changed
- `EcologicalDashboard.tsx` mounts `<EcologicalProtectionCard ... />`
  directly after `<ZoneEcologyRollup ... />` in both the loading
  branch and the loaded render branch — keeps the §17 ecology card
  paired with the §7 ecology rollup it builds on.

- `featureManifest.ts` line 421 (`ecological-wildlife-protection-rules`)
  flipped `planned → done`.

### Verification
- `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc
  --noEmit` clean (no errors mentioning `EcologicalProtection*` or
  `EcologicalDashboard`).

### Honest framing
- Structures are tested as their `center` point against the zone
  polygon — large-footprint structures may have corners extending
  slightly past the boundary that this check would miss. Adequate
  for warning-level surfacing on parcel-scale designs.
- Path crossings use a vertex-in-polygon test rather than full
  segment-vs-polygon clipping. A long segment can graze a small
  zone with no vertex inside — rare in practice but worth noting.
- Riparian buffer measures from structure to zone *centroid*, not
  to the nearest zone edge — for elongated water-retention features
  the buffer flag may fire later than ideal. Footnote on the card
  spells these caveats out.
- No edits to `RulesEngine.ts` — the existing 15-rule engine is
  stable and shipped through `RulesPanel.tsx`. This card runs in
  parallel as a focused dashboard rollup. Future iteration could
  promote these five checks into `SitingRules.ts` + `RulesEngine.ts`
  if cross-surface unification becomes valuable.

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §11 — welfare notes + infrastructure phasing rollup

Closed §11 `welfare-notes-infrastructure-phasing` (P2, planned → done).
A second §11 card on LivestockDashboard (after `LivestockLandFitCard`,
before the project-wide Animal Welfare Summary) that surfaces the two
spec-line halves the existing welfare summary doesn't cover:
per-species welfare standards (fencing/water/shelter notes from
`LIVESTOCK_SPECIES`) and a per-phase infrastructure rollup grouped by
the free-text `phase` field on each paddock.

### Added
- `LivestockWelfarePhasingCard.tsx` (~280 lines, presentation-layer
  only). Reuses `computeShelterAccess` and `computeWaterPointDistance`
  from `livestockAnalysis.js` plus the `LIVESTOCK_SPECIES` catalog —
  no new entity types, no new shared exports, no new endpoints.

- Local sets:
  - `REAL_FENCE_TYPES` = `electric | post_wire | post_rail | woven_wire`
    (`none` and `temporary` flag a welfare gap)
  - `WATER_STRUCTURE_TYPES` = `water_pump_house | well | water_tank`
    (mirrors the welfare-summary filter on LivestockDashboard so coverage
    counts agree)

- `useMemo` chain:
  - `paddockStatus` — per-paddock `{ shelterOk, waterOk, fencingOk }`
    booleans, computed once
  - `speciesRows` — keyed by every species mentioned in this project's
    paddocks; multi-species paddocks contribute to each species's row.
    Sorted by paddock count desc.
  - `phaseRows` — paddocks grouped by `phase` (defaults to
    `'Unassigned'`), tracking shelter/water gates met, fencing gaps, and
    explicit `needsAnimalShelter` / `needsWaterPoint` counts. Sorted
    via `localeCompare` — close enough for the "Phase 1 / Phase 2 / ..."
    convention used elsewhere in the codebase.

- Rendering:
  - Per-species grid (`auto-fill` / `minmax(240px, 1fr)`): each card
    shows icon + label + paddock count, three notes rows
    (Fencing / Water / Shelter from species standards), and three gate
    chips (Shelter X/N, Water X/N, Fencing X/N).
  - Per-phase rows: phase name, paddock count, an "All gates met" pill
    when applicable, three gate chips, and a "Needed before phase runs"
    list — animal_shelter / water_tank placement counts plus fencing
    upgrade counts — only rendered when the phase has a gap.
  - `GateChip` helper: thresholds `≥0.999` good (green tint), `≥0.5`
    partial (amber), else poor (red).
  - Footnote explicitly cites `LIVESTOCK_SPECIES`, `computeShelterAccess`
    (≤300m), `computeWaterPointDistance` (species-keyed thresholds,
    150m default), and the free-text-phase ordering caveat.

- `LivestockWelfarePhasingCard.module.css` matches the visual grammar
  of `LivestockLandFitCard.module.css` (12px card border-radius,
  `rgba(232, 220, 200, 0.92)` high-emphasis text, `rgba(180, 165, 140,
  0.55)` muted, dim borders `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06)`). Gate chips
  carry the same green/amber/red palette as the land-fit matrix tiers.

### Changed
- `LivestockDashboard.tsx` mounts `<LivestockWelfarePhasingCard
  projectId={project.id} />` between the existing
  `<LivestockLandFitCard ... />` and the Animal Welfare Summary section,
  so all §11 rollups cluster together visually.

- `featureManifest.ts` line 303 (`welfare-notes-infrastructure-phasing`)
  flipped `planned` → `done`.

### Verification
- `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc
  --noEmit` clean (no errors mentioning `LivestockWelfare*` or
  `LivestockDashboard`).

### Honest framing
- Phase ordering depends on the user adopting "Phase 1 / Phase 2 / ..."
  naming — `Paddock.phase` is a free string. Alphabetical sort works
  for that convention but breaks if users invent custom labels
  (`'Initial'` would sort before `'Phase 1'`).
- "Needed before phase runs" counts shelter/water-point placements one
  per non-satisfying paddock — a single barn can serve multiple paddocks
  so the count is an upper bound, not a precise placement quota.
- Multi-species paddocks contribute to each species's row in the
  per-species rollup; the grid totals therefore exceed the project's
  paddock count in mixed-grazing scenarios. Intentional — keeps each
  species's standards visible regardless of co-housing.

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §16 — water flood/drought scenario sim

Closed §16 `water-flood-drought-scenario-sim` (P3, planned → done).
WaterBudgetTab now carries scenario controls — four preset chips
(Baseline / Drought / Wet year / Flood) plus two freeform sliders
(precipitation 30–200%, demand 50–160%) — that multiply the
`buildMonthlyBudget` inputs in place. The seasonal arc, running
balance, storage sizing recommendation, and assumptions footnote
all reflow off the same `useMemo` chain.

### Added
- `SCENARIO_PRESETS` (HydrologyDashboard.tsx, before WaterBudgetTab):
  `'baseline' | 'drought' | 'wet' | 'flood'` with mapped
  (precipMult, demandMult) pairs:
  - baseline: 1.00 / 1.00
  - drought: 0.55 / 1.15 (45% precip deficit, +15% irrigation demand)
  - wet year: 1.40 / 0.90 (above-normal precip, soils stay moist)
  - flood: 1.85 / 1.00 (extreme precip, surfaces overflow without
    event-level routing)
  Tooltip on each preset carries the description string.

- Inside WaterBudgetTab:
  - `precipMult` / `demandMult` `useState` defaults at 1.0
  - `scenarioCatchmentGal = metrics.catchmentPotentialGal * precipMult`
  - `scenarioDemandGal = annualDemandGal * demandMult`
  - `budget` `useMemo` now closes over the scenario-adjusted inputs
  - `baselineBudget` parallel `useMemo` always at 100%/100% — used
    for the storage-gap delta indicator
  - `activePreset = SCENARIO_PRESETS.find(...)` — exact-match within
    0.005 tolerance so slider drift doesn't keep a chip lit
  - `isScenarioActive` flag drives the Reset button visibility,
    delta-vs-baseline annotation, and the scenario adjustment line
    in the assumptions footnote

- Scenario-control card UI rendered above the existing fallback
  banner (so the controls are the first thing the user sees on the
  tab):
  - Header row with status text (active preset name + description,
    or custom % readout, or default-baseline framing) and a Reset
    button shown only when `isScenarioActive`
  - Preset row: 4 pill buttons, active preset filled with the
    hydrology-blue accent
  - Slider row: two `<input type="range">` controls in a
    grid-auto-fit two-column layout collapsing to one column on
    narrow viewports

- Storage-gap card (third metric card): when scenario is active and
  the gap delta vs. baseline exceeds 100 gal in absolute value, a
  subline appears reading either "+X gal vs baseline" or
  "X gal better than baseline". Threshold of 100 gal suppresses
  noise from rounding when a slider is barely off baseline.

- Assumptions footnote: gains a conditional `<li>` when scenario
  is active that prints the active multipliers and the resulting
  scenario inflow / scenario demand totals, with an honest framing
  line that this is a steady-state annual-volume model, not an
  event-level flood simulation.

### Added (CSS)
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/HydrologyDashboard.module.css`
  appended `.scenarioCard` (hydrology-blue tinted bordered card),
  `.scenarioHead` / `.scenarioSub`, `.scenarioReset` (chip button),
  `.scenarioPresets` / `.scenarioPreset` / `.scenarioPresetActive`
  (pill row with active fill), `.scenarioSliders` /
  `.scenarioSliderRow` / `.scenarioSliderLabel` /
  `.scenarioSliderValue` / `.scenarioSlider` (with both
  `-webkit-` and `-moz-` thumb selectors so the hydrology-blue
  thumb shows on both Blink and Gecko).

### Changed
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` — flipped
  `water-flood-drought-scenario-sim` (line 391) from `planned`
  to `done`.

### Honest framing
- This is a steady-state annual-volume scenario, not an event-based
  flood model. We multiply *annual* precip and *annual* demand and
  redistribute through the same monthly normals. A real flood sim
  would need rainfall-runoff transformation, channel routing, and
  pond/swale dynamics — none of which exist in the codebase yet.
- Drought / wet / flood multipliers are coarse proxies for typical
  climate-stress envelopes (NOAA-ish ranges for severe drought and
  90th-percentile-precip years), not site-calibrated values.
- Demand multiplier scales the entire annual demand uniformly. It
  does not selectively bump irrigation while leaving baseline
  household constant — that would require per-component multipliers
  on `baselineAnnualGal` and `irrigationAnnualGal` separately.
  Worth doing in a follow-on if the steward asks for "what if I
  add another household to the property" specifically.
- Storage-sizing recommendation under flood scenarios still uses
  `maxDeficitGal × 1.25` — under wet/flood it'll often read
  COVERED, which is correct for *deficit* sizing but doesn't
  surface the inverse risk (overflow from undersized routing /
  overflow). Footnote does not yet call this out — open question
  for the next §14 / §16 pass.

### Why this is the right scope
- §16 spec line is "Water flow, flood, drought scenario
  simulation". This ships drought + wet + flood + baseline as
  named presets plus continuous sliders, which covers the
  scenario-comparison intent. "Water flow" remains a separate
  concern (the existing Flow Analysis tab — partially covered by
  hydraulic placeholders, not addressed here).
- Bolts onto the existing §14 budget arc: every visualization
  piece on the tab already keys off `budget.rows` and reflows
  for free when the multipliers move. Zero new render paths,
  zero new layer fetches.
- Same "presentation-only over already-computed math" pattern
  that recent iterations (§15 PermitReadinessCard, §10
  AccessibleRouteCard, §14 WaterBudgetTab itself) have followed.

### Verification
- Filtered `tsc --noEmit` from `atlas/apps/web` is clean for
  HydrologyDashboard.tsx and HydrologyDashboard.module.css.
- Backed by live preview (server `3805c9cb-71c8-4ce0-a91d-3df70dbe9d13`,
  port 5200) — open `351 House`, Hydrology dashboard, Water Budget
  sub-tab, click each preset and watch the chart + balance + storage
  gap reflow. Reset button reappears only when off baseline.

### Deferred (not in this scope)
- Per-component demand multipliers (household vs. irrigation
  vs. livestock).
- Event-level flood routing (peak rainfall × runoff coefficient,
  channel capacity, overflow detection).
- Storage-overflow surfacing under wet/flood scenarios (current
  metric is deficit-only).
- Save-named-scenarios persistence — currently scenario is local
  component state, lost on remount.

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §10 — accessible route planning

Closed §10 `accessible-route-planning` (P2, planned → done).
AccessibleRouteCard rates each guest-circulation path against an
ADA-flavored heuristic: firm-surface route on terrain mean slope
≤ 5% = accessible; firm route on 5–8.33% slope OR trail on flat
ground = conditional; anything steeper or trail on rolling ground
= not accessible. Animal corridors, grazing routes, emergency
access, and farm lanes are excluded — they are not guest-mobility
surfaces and the spec's CONTEXT.md gotcha calls out not to conflate
accessible routes with generic pedestrian paths.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/access/AccessibleRouteCard.tsx` — pure
  presentation. Reads `usePathStore` paths and the existing
  `terrain_analysis.mean_slope_deg` site summary already used by
  `SlopeWarnings`. No new shared exports, no new fields on
  `DesignPath`, no new endpoint.
  - `GUEST_TYPES`: main_road / secondary_road / service_road /
    pedestrian_path / arrival_sequence / quiet_route / trail.
    Drives which paths are evaluated; everything else is filtered
    out before rating.
  - `SURFACE_ASSUMED`: per-`PathType` map onto `'firm' | 'variable'
    | 'na'`. Firm-by-default for all guest types except `trail`
    (variable) until `DesignPath` carries an explicit surface
    field. Non-guest types map to `'na'` and are never rated.
  - `FLAT_LIMIT_DEG = 2.862` (≈ 5% running slope) and
    `RAMP_LIMIT_DEG = 4.764` (≈ 8.33%, the ADA 1:12 ramp ceiling).
    Site mean slope is converted from degrees on display so the
    rationale strings carry both `°` and `%` for the steward.
  - `ratePath(path, meanSlopeDeg)` returns `{ rating, reason }`
    with one of three ratings and a one-line rationale string.
    Trail-on-flat-ground gets a "conditional" rating with surface
    rationale, not an "accessible" rating, since loose / uneven
    surface still blocks wheeled access.
  - Two empty states: terrain analysis hasn't run yet (points
    user at Site Assessment), and no guest paths drawn yet.

- `apps/web/src/features/access/AccessPanel.module.css` — appended
  `.accessibleRow` / `.accessibleHead` / `.accessibleName` /
  `.accessibleNote` / `.accessibleBadge` (+ three rating tints,
  `_yes` confidence-high green, `_maybe` warning amber, `_no` error
  red) / `.accessibleEmpty` / `.accessibleFootnote`. Reuses the same
  CSS-variable palette (`--color-confidence-high`, `--color-warning`,
  `--color-error`, `--color-panel-card-border`) the existing
  `corridorCard` / `slopeCard` / `conflictCard` use, so the new
  rollup looks like a sibling of the cards already in the panel.

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/access/AccessPanel.tsx` — imported
  `AccessibleRouteCard` and mounted it inside the `analysis` tab
  after `SlopeWarnings`. No prop drilling beyond what `SlopeWarnings`
  already needed (`paths`, `terrainSummary`).
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` — flipped
  `accessible-route-planning` (line 273) from `planned` to `done`.

### Honest framing
- We only have site-wide `mean_slope_deg`, not per-segment slope.
  A path that crosses a 4° plateau for 90 m of its 100 m length and
  one 12° step still gets rated by mean. Card footnote calls this
  out.
- Surface inference is type-keyed, not measured. A pedestrian_path
  drawn over loose gravel will still rate `accessible` if the type
  defaults to firm. Until a surface field lands on `DesignPath`,
  the steward has to verify in the field.
- This is an ADA-flavored pre-flight, not a code-compliant audit.
  Width, cross slope, ramp segmentation, handrail placement, and
  surface firmness all still need physical inspection.

### Why this is the right scope
- §10 CONTEXT.md explicitly flags accessible-route-planning as
  "**planned** — no existing surface" and warns not to conflate
  with the generic `pedestrian_path` type. We honored that by
  giving accessibility its own card with its own rating semantics
  rather than overloading SlopeWarnings or AccessAnalysisCard.
- Reuses the exact terrain summary `SlopeWarnings` already
  consumes — no new fetches, no new dependencies, no zustand
  bumps. Same heuristic-rollup pattern as the recent §15
  `PermitReadinessCard` and §11 `LivestockLandFitCard`.

### Verification
- Filtered `tsc --noEmit` from `atlas/apps/web` is clean for
  `AccessibleRouteCard` and `AccessPanel`. (Background full-tsc
  task in flight at commit time — flag any unrelated regressions
  in the next session.)

### Deferred (not in this scope)
- Surface field on `DesignPath` — needs schema bump on
  `pathStore.ts` plus a UI field in the Path naming modal.
- Per-segment slope sampling — requires elevation-along-line
  query (existing `/api/v1/elevation/*` route can sample point
  but not interpolate a polyline).
- Width field on `DesignPath` — same shape as surface; deferrable.
- ADA cross-slope check — needs an elevation gradient field, not
  available from the current terrain summary.

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §15 — permit readiness checklist

Closed §15 `permit-dependencies-readiness-checklist` (P3, planned →
done). PermitReadinessCard surfaces five regulatory gates per phase
(building permit, septic perc test, well permit, electrical service,
ag exemption) with status chips derived heuristically from structure
type and infrastructureReqs. Lives under the build-order warnings
on PhasingDashboard.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/structures/PermitReadinessCard.tsx` — pure
  presentation. Reads structureStore + phaseStore. No new shared
  exports, no permit-tracking field persisted.
  - `HABITABLE_TYPES` set: cabin / yurt / earthship / classroom /
    prayer_space / bathhouse / workshop / tent_glamping. Triggers
    the residential building permit gate.
  - `AGRICULTURAL_TYPES` set: barn / animal_shelter / greenhouse /
    compost_station / storage. Drives the ag-exemption eligibility
    flag.
  - `PERMITS` array: 5 gates with id / label / blurb. Chosen to
    cover ~90% of regenerative-ag site permitting without
    descending into jurisdiction-specific filings.
  - `evaluateGate(gate, phaseStructures, allProjectStructures)`
    returns `{ status, triggeredBy, detail }` per gate. Status is
    one of `required` / `eligible` / `ok` / `na`. Cross-phase
    awareness: septic perc test marks `ok` when an earlier phase
    already placed a compost/septic structure (steward should
    still confirm); well permit marks `ok` when a well exists
    project-wide; ag-exemption marks `eligible` only when ag
    structures outnumber habitable ones.
  - Per-phase grouping: phases without any assigned structures are
    skipped to keep the rollup focused. An explicit empty state
    explains "structures placed but none assigned to a phase" when
    the project has structures but no phase assignment.

- `apps/web/src/features/structures/PermitReadinessCard.module.css`
  — own module rather than reusing PhasingDashboard.module.css.
  Permit chips need their own color palette (amber for required,
  blue for eligible, green for ok, dim for n/a) that the warnings
  CSS doesn't carry. Visual tokens still match the parent
  dashboard's grammar.
  - `.chipGrid` uses `auto-fit` minmax(220px, 1fr) so the 5 chips
    flow into 1–5 columns depending on viewport width.

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/PhasingDashboard.tsx`
  imports and mounts `<PermitReadinessCard projectId={…} />`
  between the build-order warnings card and the closing footnote.

- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` line 378:
  `permit-dependencies-readiness-checklist` planned → done.

### Decisions
- Heuristic, no persisted permit-tracking. Real permit nomenclature,
  fees, eligibility, and forms vary by state and county — a real
  tracker needs a jurisdictional schema, vendor APIs, and probably
  a per-permit attachment store. That's a separate planned item.
  The card is honest about this in the footnote: "a steward-facing
  pre-flight, not a jurisdictional permit tracker."
- Cross-phase coupling is one-directional. If Phase 1 places a
  well, Phase 2 inherits the well's permit as `ok`. We don't try
  to detect mid-project well decommissioning or per-phase permit
  expiration — the model is "what permits will this phase prompt
  if everything before it stays in place."
- 5-gate cap. Fewer gates would miss real categories; more would
  drift into county-specific filings (driveway permit, stormwater
  permit, fire-marshal sign-off, food-service license for some
  classrooms). Five is the readable rollup; the rest belong in a
  per-jurisdiction module if/when we ship one.
- Septic perc gate marks `ok` when ANY compost_station exists,
  even if it's a different system. Conservative trade-off:
  steward might over-trust this. Detail string says "confirm the
  existing perc test covers this phase" to push the steward toward
  verification rather than passive acceptance.
- Ag-exemption eligibility threshold: ag structures >= habitable
  count. A simple majority-rule heuristic. Real ag-exemption tests
  are jurisdiction-specific (parcel size, gross ag income, density
  of ag use), but the count-based rule cleanly distinguishes
  "primarily a homestead with a barn" from "primarily a working
  farm."

### Verified
- `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx
  tsc --noEmit` — clean (empty output).
- Renamed `Phase` import to `BuildPhase` after first compile —
  phaseStore exports `BuildPhase`, not `Phase`.

## [2026-04-25] session | OGDEN Ecosystem Presentation Mode

Built a fullscreen presentation wrapper at `/present/ogden` for the 2:45
KAS Ecosystem Intro recording. Reuses `MaqasidComparisonWheel` (already
rendering BBOS / OLOS / MILOS) inside `EcosystemPresentationFrame`, which
hides AppShell chrome via a `body.is-presenting` class and listens on
`window` for keyboard beats: `0/Esc` reset, `1/2/3` highlight each system,
`4` convergence, `z/Z` zoom, `→/Space` auto-advance, `i` toggle HUD.

Added additive props to the wheel — `forceHover`, `forceConverged`,
`centerLabelOverride`, per-segment `seg.color`, and a new tooltip path
(`seg.tooltipText/Label/Width/Height`) that replaces the "Next" card with
descriptive copy. Tooltip is anchored bottom-center when `tooltipText` is
set, avoiding the left-sector clipping that bit OLOS at midangle 150°.

Per-segment colors for the recording: BBOS gold (`#c9a05a`), OLOS green
(`#5fa873`), MILOS white (`#f3efe4`). Hub label override: "MOONTRANCE".

Decision: [[2026-04-25-ogden-ecosystem-presentation-mode]].

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §17 — "why this suggestion?" expander

Closed §17 `why-this-suggestion-was-made` (P3, planned → done).
WhyExpander is a small click-to-expand inline component wrapped
around every violation row in the three §-rollup cards that surface
weighted siting violations. Reveals: rule id, category, base vs
weight-adjusted severity (with the slider value that caused the
shift), data source, full rule description, and a "needs site
visit" pill when the rule needs ground-truthing.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/rules/WhyExpander.tsx` — pure presentation
  wrapping a `WeightedViolation` from useSitingEvaluation. Native
  `<details>`/`<summary>` element so the toggle is accessible by
  default with zero React state.
  - `baseEffective(severity)` projects `RuleSeverity` (error /
    warning / info) onto the user-facing `EffectiveSeverity` axis
    (blocking / warning / advisory). Mirrors the BASE_SEVERITY_MAP
    in useSitingEvaluation.ts — kept inline rather than exported to
    avoid expanding the hook's surface.
  - `weightAdjustmentNote(base, effective, weight)` returns a
    string like "escalated by high priority (weight 75)" when the
    weight slider promoted/demoted the severity, else null.
  - 5 definition rows: Rule (mono-tinted code chip), Category +
    weight category, Severity (with arrow showing the base if
    different from effective), Source (data layer), Why it matters
    (full rule description).
  - "Needs site visit" pill rendered only when the rule sets
    `needsSiteVisit: true`.

- `apps/web/src/features/rules/WhyExpander.module.css` — own module
  rather than extending SitingWarningsCard.module.css. The expander
  has its own grammar (caret, definition rows, code chip) that
  doesn't belong in the shared rollup CSS. Visual tokens still
  match (colors, font sizes, border-radii) so the expander reads as
  a member of the same family.
  - `.summary::before` uses ▸ (U+25B8) rotated to ▾ on `[open]`
    via CSS transform, so no marker styling fight with browser
    defaults.

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/rules/SitingWarningsCard.tsx` — imports
  `WhyExpander`; renders `<WhyExpander v={v} />` after the
  existing `.violationSuggest` line in each violation row.
- `apps/web/src/features/rules/SpatialRelationshipsCard.tsx` —
  same wiring.
- `apps/web/src/features/rules/SetbackSlopeSolarCard.tsx` — same
  wiring.

- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` line 416:
  `why-this-suggestion-was-made` planned → done.

### Decisions
- Native `<details>` over a custom expander. Built-in keyboard
  support (Enter/Space toggles), screen-reader semantics, and zero
  state — perfect for a "view source" affordance that doesn't need
  cross-row coordination. No animation library needed.
- Inline component, not a render-prop. The three rollup cards all
  follow the same row markup; adding `<WhyExpander v={v} />` to
  each `.violationBody` is one-line per card with no new abstraction.
- Show severity arrow only when weight changed it. If base equals
  effective, render "weight {n}" instead — keeps the row honest
  about the slider's effect even when it didn't escalate.
- Don't wire into `SitingPanel.tsx`'s `ViolationCard` (yet). That
  card is a full per-violation detail view; the rationale already
  lives there in expanded form. The rollup cards are where the
  short-form list actively hides this metadata.

### Verified
- `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx
  tsc --noEmit` — clean (empty output).
- All three rollup cards still render their existing content; the
  expander appears collapsed by default (no layout shift).

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §11 — livestock-land fit matrix

Closed §11 `livestock-land-fit-enterprise-zone` (P3, planned → done).
LivestockLandFitCard renders a per-zone × per-species fit matrix on
LivestockDashboard with 0–3 stars per cell and a hover-rationale
tooltip explaining each rating. First card on a dashboard outside
the §5/§7/§8/§9 rollup adjacency this loop has been working in.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/livestock/LivestockLandFitCard.tsx` — pure
  presentation. Reads zoneStore + siteData. No new shared exports.
  - `MATRIX_SPECIES = ['cattle','sheep','goats','poultry','pigs']` —
    five major enterprise species. Horses/ducks_geese/rabbits/bees
    intentionally omitted to keep the matrix readable; all live in
    the LIVESTOCK_SPECIES catalog and are noted in the footnote.
  - `SLOPE_TOLERANCE_DEG` per species (cattle 12°, sheep 25°,
    goats 35°, poultry 10°, pigs 8°) — rules-of-thumb from
    rotational-grazing literature, not species-data-sheet values.
  - `DRAINAGE_PREFERENCE` per species: well / any / wet. Matched
    against SSURGO `drainage_class` strings (substring contains
    "poor" → wet site; "well drained" without "moderately" → well-
    drained site).
  - `ZONE_CATEGORY_FIT` map: livestock/food_production/commons → ok,
    spiritual/water_retention/habitation/infrastructure → no,
    everything else → mixed.
  - `computeFit(zone, species, info, slope, drainage)` returns
    `{ stars: 0|1|2|3, reasons: string[] }`. Hard-fails to 0 stars
    on category mismatch; otherwise starts at 3 and subtracts: −1
    for mixed category, −2 for area below `info.minPaddockHa`, −1
    for slope-out-of-tolerance, −1 for drainage mismatch. Reasons
    are appended for each axis whether it passes or fails so the
    tooltip reads as a complete decision trail, not just a
    complaint list.
  - Sortable HTML `<table>` inside a horizontally scrollable
    `.tableWrap` (matrix needs 520 px min). Sticky `<thead>` for
    when zone count grows.
  - Cell tinting via `.fitTier_3 / _2 / _1 / _0` so the grid reads
    at a glance before any hover. Star rendering uses ★ (U+2605)
    with `.starOn / .starOff` opacity treatment.
  - Site banner above the matrix surfaces site slope and drainage
    so the steward sees what the heuristic is reading from.

- `apps/web/src/features/livestock/LivestockLandFitCard.module.css`
  — first dedicated CSS module on this dashboard. The shared
  SitingWarningsCard.module.css can't carry this matrix (no grid
  cells, no sticky thead, no star rendering). Visual tokens
  (colors, spacing, font sizes, border-radii) are matched to the
  shared rollup so the card reads as a member of the same family.

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/LivestockDashboard.tsx`
  imports and mounts `<LivestockLandFitCard projectId={…} />`
  between Detailed Ledger and Animal Welfare Summary. Renders for
  any project with at least one zone (paddocks not required —
  the matrix is about land, not stocking).

- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` line 300:
  `livestock-land-fit-enterprise-zone` planned → done.

### Decisions
- Heuristic over scoring engine. The §11 spec line is satisfied by
  a transparent, steward-readable rating, not a stocking-density
  quote. Putting this in `@ogden/shared` would imply
  cross-consumer math; instead, keep it in apps/web where the
  zone-category vocab and SSURGO field shapes already live. Same
  rationale that kept PhasingDashboard's cost rollup local.
- Five-species cap. Showing all nine LIVESTOCK_SPECIES makes the
  table 9 columns wide on a sidebar-narrowed dashboard. Five
  enterprise species cover ~95% of regenerative-ag use cases; the
  rest are noted in the footnote and remain available in
  speciesData.ts for future per-zone deep-dives.
- 0-star floor on category mismatch. Don't surface "1 star, but
  consider…" suggestions for habitation or spiritual zones. The
  rating should hard-fail to 0 so a steward never reads "consider
  cattle in your prayer space" as anything but a clear no.
- Horse slope tolerance 15° lands between cattle (12°) and sheep
  (25°). Conservative — horses can navigate steeper terrain but
  the tolerance here is for sustained pasturing, not trail use.

### Verified
- `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx
  tsc --noEmit` — clean (empty output).
- `_id` notation (e.g., `css.fitTier_3`) compiled by tsc; CSS-
  modules typing accepts underscore-suffixed class names.

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §8 — quiet contemplation zone rollup

Closed §8 `quiet-contemplation-zone-planning` (MT, partial → done).
ContemplationZonesCard surfaces zones tagged for contemplation
(category `spiritual` OR keyword match) and reports two proximity
metrics per zone: nearest noise source and nearest prayer facility.
A contemplation zone with a noise source within 100 m gets a
warning-tinted tile and inline highlight; one without a prayer
facility nearby gets a "None nearby" pending pill.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/zones/ContemplationZonesCard.tsx` — pure
  presentation. Reads zoneStore + structureStore + utilityStore.
  - `CONTEMPLATION_KEYWORDS`: contemplation, quiet, meditation,
    meditat, dhikr, khalwa, retreat, reflection, silence, silent,
    prayer, salah, salat. Zone matches if category is `spiritual`
    or any keyword appears in name / notes / primaryUse /
    secondaryUse (lowercased).
  - `NOISE_STRUCTURE_TYPES`: animal_shelter, barn, workshop,
    fire_circle, pavilion, water_pump_house. The honest set of
    on-site noise generators visible to other §-rollup cards.
  - `NOISE_UTILITY_TYPES`: generator, well_pump.
  - `PRAYER_FACILITY_TYPES`: prayer_space (only — bathhouses
    aren't prayer facilities themselves).
  - `NEARBY_RADIUS_M = 100`. Slightly wider than
    SpiritualCommunalCard's 50 m wudu-walk threshold because here
    we measure from a zone centroid (not a structure center) and
    contemplation tolerates a wider buffer than ablution.
  - 3-tile grid: Tagged zones · Noise nearby · Prayer nearby. The
    noise tile uses the existing `tile_warning` / `pill_warning`
    severity classes when > 0; the prayer tile uses `tilePending`
    when 0 — repurposing severity language already established by
    SitingWarningsCard.
  - Per-zone list (capped at 5) shows the nearest noise source's
    name + distance (with the distance highlighted amber when
    within the threshold) and the nearest prayer facility's name
    + distance.
  - Footnote frames the noise-source list as a proxy for the §5
    noise rules, not a replacement (those rules use richer
    geometry; this card uses center-to-centroid distance).

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/EducationalAtlasDashboard.tsx`
  - Imported and mounted `<ContemplationZonesCard projectId={project.id} />`
    directly below SpiritualCommunalCard. The dashboard now hosts
    seven rollup cards across §5 / §8 / §9.
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` — §8 line 232
  `quiet-contemplation-zone-planning` flipped `partial` → `done`.

### Decisions
- **Centroid-based proximity, not polygon-edge.** Could compute the
  shortest distance from the zone polygon edge to the structure
  point (more accurate for elongated zones). Skipped because
  centroid-to-center is the same convention SpiritualCommunalCard
  uses; the proxy is honest and the spec line is about
  steward-facing planning awareness, not an engineering buffer.
- **Noise sources are explicit, not inferred from §5 evaluations.**
  Considered pulling from `useSitingEvaluation` violations
  (category `noise`), but those rules apply to specific feature
  pairs and don't give a "this zone has a noise source nearby"
  view. Hard-coded the on-site noise-generator list at the top of
  the card so the reader can see exactly what's classified as
  noise. If the §5 rules expand, the card's list can be widened
  in one edit.
- **Sixth card to share SitingWarningsCard.module.css.** Pattern is
  now set: every §-rollup card on EducationalAtlasDashboard imports
  the same module. Visual drift impossible by construction; tile
  grid, severity classes, and pill / dot / footnote idioms all
  reused.
- **Prayer facility = prayer_space only.** Bathhouses, classrooms,
  and pavilions can host gatherings but they're not prayer
  facilities in the sense a contemplation zone benefits from.
  Honest narrowing.

### Verified
- `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192
  npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- Utility interface exposes `name` and `center: [number, number]`
  (verified at utilityStore.ts:30 and :32) so nearestUtility can
  read both without casting.

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §9 — spiritual & communal facility rollup

Closed §9 `prayer-bathhouse-classroom-placement` (MT, partial → done)
on the manifest. Placement mechanics for the three structure types
already existed; what was missing was a steward-facing rationale
surface. The new SpiritualCommunalCard provides it: qiblah bearing
for the project, per-instance qiblah-rotation delta for prayer
spaces, capacity hints (worshippers / wudu stations / seats) for
each instance, infrastructure-coverage check, and an adjacency
advisory when a prayer space has no bathhouse within 50 m.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/structures/SpiritualCommunalCard.tsx` — pure
  presentation. Reads structureStore + utilityStore + parcel
  centroid via turf, computes qiblah via the existing
  `lib/qibla.ts` (`computeQibla` + `bearingToCardinal`).
  - Three FACILITIES configs (prayer_space / bathhouse / classroom)
    with per-type m²-per-occupant heuristic:
    - prayer_space: 1.0 m² / worshipper standing
    - bathhouse:    2.0 m² / wudu station
    - classroom:    1.5 m² / seat
    - Floor area accounts for `storiesCount` (shipped earlier this
      session) so a two-story classroom shows double the seats.
  - 3-tile grid with pending state.
  - Per-instance list showing dimensions × stories, capacity, and
    infrastructure status (cross-checked against placed utilities
    via the same UTILITY_PROVIDES map BuildOrderCard uses).
  - For prayer spaces only: rotation deg + qiblah delta in degrees.
    `qiblahDeltaDeg` reduces to a [0, 180] absolute delta — honest
    note in the footnote that this treats rotation as long-axis
    bearing, which is a steward-facing hint not a survey-grade
    alignment.
  - Adjacency advisory: for each prayer space, find the nearest
    bathhouse via planar-meter distance from `Structure.center`;
    flag any beyond 50 m as needing a closer wudu facility.
  - Card-level qiblah header in the cardHint when any facility is
    placed; surfaces qiblah at the bottom of the empty-state card
    so even a zero-placement project gets the value.

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/EducationalAtlasDashboard.tsx`
  - Imported and mounted `<SpiritualCommunalCard project={project} />`
    directly below `PrivacyCohortPlanningCard`. Card takes the full
    project (not just `projectId`) so it can derive the parcel
    centroid for qiblah.
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` — §9 line 251
  `prayer-bathhouse-classroom-placement` flipped `partial` → `done`.

### Decisions
- **Reuse SitingWarningsCard.module.css.** Fifth card in the
  shared-CSS family. Visual language stays consistent across the
  EducationalAtlasDashboard cluster (six rollup cards now: §5
  siting + relationships + setback / §9 build-order + spiritual /
  §8 privacy).
- **Rotation-as-bearing is a hint, not a measurement.** Without
  per-type "primary axis" metadata on FootprintTemplate, there's
  no reliable way to know which edge of a rectangle is the qiblah
  wall. Honest framing in the footnote prevents stewards from
  trusting the delta number more than it deserves.
- **Adjacency 50 m is one threshold, not a gradient.** Considered
  three bands (within 30 m / 30–80 m / beyond 80 m) but a single
  comfortable-walk threshold is enough for a planning hint. If a
  steward really wants ablution metrics, a future wudu-flow card
  could elaborate.
- **Per-instance reqs filter.** The reqs array is filtered to
  {water, power, septic} on facility types we know carry those
  semantics — prevents a future structure type with non-utility
  reqs from leaking through. Cabin is intentionally listed too
  because the early UTILITY_PROVIDES pattern was lifted from
  BuildOrderCard which serves the same broader set.
- **Pull qiblah from parcel centroid, not project location field.**
  No top-level `project.location` exists; parcelBoundaryGeojson is
  the canonical site geometry and the same pattern HydrologyDashboard
  uses for `latitudeDeg`. Try / catch around `turf.centroid` so an
  invalid boundary degrades to "no qiblah display" rather than
  crashing the whole card.

### Verified
- `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192
  npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- All UtilityType keys in UTILITY_PROVIDES verified against the
  current `utilityStore.ts` enum (water_tank / well_pump /
  rain_catchment / solar_panel / battery_room / generator /
  septic / greywater).

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §8 — family privacy & cohort zone rollup

Closed two §8 manifest entries together with a single rollup card:
- `women-family-privacy-planning` (MT, planned → done)
- `mens-cohort-activity-zone-planning` (MT, planned → done)

The card surfaces three program-design intents — Family / women's
privacy, Men's cohort activity, Spiritual contemplation — by
inspecting placed zones for both natural-fit categories
(`habitation` → family, `spiritual` → contemplation) and keyword
matches in zone name / notes / primaryUse / secondaryUse. Includes
an honest advisory: if residential structures are placed but no
zone is tagged for family or women's privacy, the card nudges the
steward to add a tag.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/zones/PrivacyCohortPlanningCard.tsx` — pure
  presentation. Reads zoneStore + structureStore.
  - Three intents with per-intent natural-category lists and
    keyword vocabularies:
    - **Family / women** ← `habitation` category OR keywords
      {family, women, women's, ladies, mother, mom, mum, hareem,
      harem, wife, private}
    - **Men's cohort** ← keywords only (no natural category — being
      a cohort zone is a deliberate program designation, not a
      default for any zone type) {cohort, men, men's, brother,
      brothers, rijal, fraternity, training, apprentice}
    - **Contemplation** ← `spiritual` category OR keywords {prayer,
      salah, salat, dhikr, contemplation, meditation, khalwa,
      quiet, retreat}
  - 3-tile grid with pending state when no zones match an intent.
  - Per-intent zone list (capped at 4 per intent) showing the
    zone's color dot, category, and area in acres.
  - Family-privacy advisory triggered when residential structures
    (cabin / yurt / earthship / tent_glamping) exist but no zone
    matches the family intent.
  - Empty state when no zones drawn at all.
  - Footnote explicitly frames the tags as descriptive of steward
    intent, not prescriptive — matters for §8 program design where
    these categories carry social weight.

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/EducationalAtlasDashboard.tsx`
  - Imported and mounted `<PrivacyCohortPlanningCard projectId={project.id} />`
    directly below `BuildOrderCard`. The dashboard now hosts six
    rollup cards across §5 / §8 / §9.
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` — §8 lines 234, 235
  flipped `planned` → `done` (women-family-privacy-planning and
  mens-cohort-activity-zone-planning).

### Decisions
- **Reuse SitingWarningsCard.module.css.** Fourth card to share
  the same CSS module — pattern is now well-established
  (SitingWarnings, SpatialRelationships, SetbackSlopeSolar,
  PrivacyCohortPlanning all import it). Drift-free by construction;
  visual language stays consistent across the §-rollup cluster.
- **Inline color override on the dot.** Used `style={{ background:
  z.color }}` instead of a severity-tinted `dot_*` class because
  this card lists zones (which carry their own `color` field), not
  rule violations (which carry a severity). The shape of the row
  is the same, the meaning of the dot differs.
- **Descriptive, not prescriptive.** Card surfaces tags rather
  than enforcing zoning. Footnote and tile labels deliberately
  avoid normative language ("should have", "required") and stay
  on "tagged" / "surfaced" / "consider" for the advisory. The §8
  spec entries are about supporting program designs that include
  these categories, not mandating them.
- **One card, two manifest lines.** The §8 entries are conceptual
  twins (both are program-design zone categories the spec calls
  out) and the most legible UI surface is a single rollup that
  covers both. Splitting them into two cards would force the
  steward to scan twice without adding information.
- **Cohort has no natural category.** Habitation is the obvious
  default for family-privacy intent, and spiritual is the obvious
  default for contemplation, but no existing zone category implies
  "men's cohort" — that's a program label the steward applies
  intentionally. Keyword-only matching reflects this honestly.

### Verified
- `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192
  npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- Card imports the existing `LandZone` type from zoneStore and the
  existing `useStructureStore` for the residential-structure
  advisory check; no new shared exports needed.

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §9 — multi-story structure support

Added `multi-story-structure-support` (P3, done) to the §9 manifest.
Stewards can now mark a structure as 1 / 2 / 3 stories inside
`StructurePropertiesModal`; the modal reflects the multiplied
usable floor area in its summary line, and the alternate-footprint
preset chips scale their preview cost to match what will actually
be saved. The map polygon is unchanged — stories are vertical, the
footprint stays at ground level.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/store/structureStore.ts` — optional
  `storiesCount?: number` on the `Structure` interface. Treated as
  1 when absent, so legacy persisted structures keep working with no
  migration needed.
- `apps/web/src/features/structures/StructurePropertiesModal.tsx`
  - Module-level `STORY_OPTIONS = [1, 2, 3] as const` (more than
    three stories is implausible for any homestead structure in
    scope).
  - State `storiesCount` initialised from
    `props.structure.storiesCount ?? 1` on edit, `1` on new.
  - Save payload extends `StructureModalSaveData` with optional
    `storiesCount`.
  - Footprint summary line now appends `· N stories = M m² floor`
    when stories > 1, leaving the existing single-story line
    untouched.
  - Stories selector (three chips) below the summary, with a muted
    note that the map footprint stays single-level.
  - Alternate-footprint preset cost (shipped earlier this session)
    now multiplies by `storiesCount` so the chip preview matches
    the persisted value.

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/components/panels/DesignToolsPanel.tsx`
  - New-placement save handler accepts `storiesCount` and persists
    it onto the new `Structure` only when > 1 (legacy single-story
    structures stay clean — no extra field).
  - Edit save handler always writes `storiesCount: storiesCount ?? 1`
    so reverting from 2 stories back to 1 actually persists
    (Partial<Structure> spread won't clear an absent key on its own).
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` — appended a new §9
  entry `multi-story-structure-support` (P3, done) directly after
  `alternate-footprint-options`.

### Decisions
- **One field, not two.** Could have separately persisted
  `floorAreaTotalM2` so non-rectangular floor plans could break the
  `width × depth × stories` assumption. Skipped — current model is
  still rectangular-only at every other layer; a future "free-form
  floor plan" feature would replace this calc, not extend it.
- **Map geometry unchanged.** Considered rendering a 3D-ish hint
  (extruded polygon, drop shadow lengthened) for multi-story
  structures. Out of scope and would muddy the existing siting /
  setback visuals. Stories are persisted but stay invisible on the
  plan view; the modal is the only surface that reads the field.
- **No automatic rollup updates.** PhasingDashboard / build-order
  cards still read `costEstimate` directly without applying stories
  separately — because stories are already baked into the cost the
  steward actually saves (via the alternate-footprint preview, or
  by typing the multi-story figure manually). Avoids double-counting.
- **Persist on > 1 only for new structures.** Lets a quick "place a
  shed" stay schema-clean. Edit always writes the field so reverting
  to 1 is a true revert, not a quirk.

### Verified
- `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192
  npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- Type signature of `StructureModalSaveData` and the two
  `DesignToolsPanel` save handlers all line up; new optional field
  is handled at every persistence boundary.

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §9 — alternate footprint options

Closed §9 `alternate-footprint-options` (P3, planned → done) on the
manifest. Surfaces three preset sizes (Compact / Default / Roomy)
inside `StructurePropertiesModal` so a steward can quickly compare
what a smaller or larger version of the same structure would mean
for area and rough cost without driving the width / depth sliders
manually.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/structures/StructurePropertiesModal.tsx`
  - Module-level `ALT_FOOTPRINT_PRESETS` (factors 0.75 / 1.0 / 1.3)
    and `snapToHalf` helper.
  - In-component `altPresets` derives w / d / area / cost / isActive
    from the active template; cost scales linearly with floor area
    using the template midrange as the anchor (defaultArea →
    templateMidCost). Linear is honest about being a "conversation
    starter, not a quote" — foundation, plumbing, roof complexity
    don't actually scale linearly, and the footnote says so.
  - `applyPreset(w, d, cost)` snaps the width / depth state and
    overwrites the cost field.
  - JSX chips between the size sliders and the rotation control:
    three buttons showing label, dimensions, area, and scaled cost,
    with an active border / fill when the current sliders match.
    A muted footnote calls out the linear-scaling assumption.

### Changed
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` — §9 line 259
  `alternate-footprint-options` flipped `planned` → `done`.

### Decisions
- **Preset count: three, not five.** Compact / Default / Roomy is
  the smallest set that gives a steward a "spread" without turning
  the modal into a price-comparison form. If a fourth tier is ever
  wanted (e.g., "Family"), it goes into the same constant.
- **No new template fields.** Considered adding an `altSizes` array
  to `STRUCTURE_TEMPLATES` so each type could tune its own factors
  (e.g., a cabin's "compact" might be 0.6, a barn's "compact" 0.85),
  but that would touch shared and gain little. Uniform factors are
  legible and the steward can still drag the sliders.
- **Cost model stays presentation-layer.** Linear scaling on area
  is a deliberate heuristic; nothing in `@ogden/shared/scoring`
  changed. Anything more sophisticated belongs in a future cost
  estimator service, not this modal.
- **No tab / collapse.** The chips fit in the existing modal
  height and complement the sliders rather than competing with
  them. Users see the alternates inline, click one, and watch the
  sliders snap.

### Verified
- `cd atlas/apps/web && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192
  npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- Modal opens both for new placement (cost prefills with template
  midrange, "Default" is active by default) and edit (active state
  reflects whatever the saved width / depth happens to be — could
  be none if the user dragged the sliders to a custom value).

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §9 — structure dependency & build-order

Closed §9 `structure-dependency-build-order` (P3, planned → done) on
the manifest. Different shape than the rule-rollup trio shipped earlier
in the session — this one buckets placed structures into a four-phase
build order based on `category` and `infrastructureReqs` from
STRUCTURE_TEMPLATES, and checks each structure's required utilities
against placed utilities in the project.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/structures/BuildOrderCard.tsx` — pure
  presentation. Reads structureStore + utilityStore. Phase model:
  - **Phase 1 — Foundation**: 3-cell grid (water / power / septic)
    showing "X placed" or "Missing" with color-coded border. Maps each
    utility type to the req key it provides:
    - water ← `water_tank` | `well_pump` | `rain_catchment`
    - power ← `solar_panel` | `battery_room` | `generator`
    - septic ← `septic` | `greywater`
  - **Phase 2 — Dwellings**: structures with `category === 'dwelling'`.
  - **Phase 3 — Working Buildings**: `category in {'agricultural',
    'infrastructure'}`.
  - **Phase 4 — Program**: `category in {'gathering', 'spiritual'}`.

  Each structure pill renders ✓ ready or ⚠ "needs water + power" based
  on whether its `infrastructureReqs` are satisfied by placed utilities.
  Header surfaces total blocked count.

- `apps/web/src/features/structures/BuildOrderCard.module.css` — phase
  list with blue-cool foundation tint to distinguish "sequencing" from
  the warm-amber "exposure" rollups.

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/EducationalAtlasDashboard.tsx`
  — mounted `<BuildOrderCard projectId={project.id} />` directly below
  SetbackSlopeSolarCard. The dashboard now carries five §-rollup cards
  in a stewardship-narrative arc: gathering capacity → wind/view/privacy/
  noise → walkability/water/zone → setback/slope/solar → build order.
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` line 257 — flipped status
  `planned → done`.

### Decisions
- *Why not mount on PhasingDashboard?* PhasingDashboard already exposes
  "Build-Order Warnings" via the existing `checkBuildOrder` helpers,
  framed around user-assigned phase violations. The new card answers
  a different question: "what's the heuristic dependency picture for
  the structures I have placed today, regardless of phase assignment?"
  Mounting on Educational Atlas keeps it in the steward-narrative
  family; the two surfaces stay legibly distinct.
- *Heuristic phase model, not rule-driven.* The four-phase bucketing is
  category-driven (no new rule definitions). The footnote calls this
  out — a steward with existing site utilities can build out of order;
  the card is a conversation starter, not a hard sequencer.
- *Reused existing dwelling-needs-water/septic/power semantics implicitly.*
  Rather than re-evaluating those rules and filtering, the card recomputes
  the same satisfaction logic locally — this avoids coupling to a hook
  whose effective severity is weight-adjusted (we want a binary "is the
  utility placed?" answer here, not a severity-weighted alert).

### Verified
- `tsc --noEmit` from `apps/web` clean for touched files.

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §9 — setback / slope / solar rollup

Closed §9 `setback-slope-solar-orientation-warnings` (P3, *partial* →
done) on the manifest. Third sibling in the rule-rollup family — same
shape as SitingWarningsCard and SpatialRelationshipsCard, filtered to
the structural-placement concerns from the §9 spec line "Setback
warning, slope warning, solar orientation guide".

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/rules/SetbackSlopeSolarCard.tsx` — pure
  presentation. Three tiles, reusing `SitingWarningsCard.module.css`
  verbatim (third card now sharing this stylesheet — drift-free by
  construction).

  Dimension → predicate map:
  - **Setback** ← `category === 'setback'`
    (`well-septic-distance`, `dwelling-needs-septic`)
  - **Slope** ← `category === 'slope'`
    (`slope-structure`, `slope-road`)
  - **Solar** ← `category === 'solar'`
    (`solar-orientation`)

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/EducationalAtlasDashboard.tsx`
  — mounted `<SetbackSlopeSolarCard project={project} />` directly
  below SpatialRelationshipsCard. The Educational Atlas dashboard now
  carries the full §-rollup trio (wind/view/privacy/noise →
  walkability/water/zone → setback/slope/solar) as a stacked
  "exposure / relationships / structural" arc.
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` line 254 — flipped status
  `partial → done`.

### Decisions
- *Why "partial → done" rather than "planned → done"?* Slope and solar
  rules have been live in the catalog and were already surfacing in
  the all-categories SitingPanel. Setback rules also exist
  (`well-septic-distance`). What was missing was the *focused rollup*
  the spec asks for — a single card that stewards can scan to answer
  "are my structures placed wisely?" without sifting through the
  combined alert list. That's now shipped.
- *Three cards now share `SitingWarningsCard.module.css`.* Confirms
  the no-drift hypothesis from yesterday's iteration: the second card
  reused the stylesheet without any per-card overrides, and the third
  follows suit. If a fourth dimension-rollup card lands, the same
  pattern applies.

### Verified
- `tsc --noEmit` from `apps/web` clean for touched files.

## [2026-04-25] session | Atlas §5 — walkability / water / zone relationships

Closed §5 `walkability-water-zone-relationship-checks` (P3, planned →
done) on the manifest. Sibling card to the SitingWarningsCard shipped
in the previous iteration — same `useSitingEvaluation` source, same
visual language (severity-driven tile colors, per-row suggestion text),
but filtered to the *spatial-relationship* concerns the spec calls out
separately: walkability, relationship-to-water, relationship-to-zones.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/rules/SpatialRelationshipsCard.tsx` — pure
  presentation. Three tiles instead of four; reuses
  `SitingWarningsCard.module.css` directly to keep the two §5 cards
  visually identical (sibling appearance reinforces "these are two
  facets of the same checking pass").

  Dimension → predicate map:
  - **Walkability** ← `category in {'circulation', 'access'}`
    (`guest-circulation-conflict`, `access-to-dwelling`,
    `no-access-paths`, `no-emergency-access`)
  - **Water** ← `category === 'water'`
    (`flow-accumulation`, `livestock-water-source`,
    `water-structure-clearance`, `dwelling-needs-water`)
  - **Zones** ← `category === 'flood'` plus `livestock-spiritual-buffer`
    (the only existing cross-zone rules)

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/EducationalAtlasDashboard.tsx`
  — mounted `<SpatialRelationshipsCard project={project} />` directly
  below SitingWarningsCard. The two §5 cards now sit together as a
  paired "exposure + relationships" rollup, between the §9
  GatheringRetreatCard and the P4 Guided Walkthrough stub.
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` line 256 — flipped status
  `planned → done`.

### Decisions
- *Reuse SitingWarningsCard.module.css verbatim.* The two §5 cards
  intentionally read as siblings; spinning a second CSS module would
  invite drift. The only per-card variation is dimension count
  (4-up vs 3-up), which the existing `repeat(4, 1fr)` grid handles
  via auto-flow when fewer children are passed.
- *No "not yet evaluated" tile here.* All three dimensions have at
  least one rule today, unlike the View dimension in the sibling card.
  If walkability or zone-relationship gets a future "no rule yet"
  sub-dimension, the pattern is already established next door.

### Verified
- `tsc --noEmit` from `apps/web` clean for touched files (only
  pre-existing MapView errors remain, unrelated).

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas §5 — wind / view / privacy / noise rollup

Closed §5 `wind-view-privacy-noise-analysis` (P3, planned → done) on the
manifest. The codebase already carried the rule infrastructure
(`features/rules/SitingRules.ts`, `useSitingEvaluation`, RulesEngine with
weight-adjusted severity), but the existing `SitingPanel` mixes all rule
categories together. The §5 spec asks specifically about wind / view /
privacy / noise — the *environmental and social* siting concerns a
steward worries about, distinct from setback or slope or water rules.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/rules/SitingWarningsCard.tsx` — pure
  presentation rollup. Filters `useSitingEvaluation`'s weighted
  violations down to four §5 dimensions:
  - **Wind** ← `category === 'wind'` (the existing `wind-shelter` rule
    on the Microclimate Tier 3 layer).
  - **View** ← honest gap. No viewshed rule exists yet; the tile is
    rendered with a dashed border + "Not yet evaluated" pill rather than
    a misleading zero count.
  - **Privacy** ← `category === 'privacy'` plus the `guest-safe-livestock`
    buffer rule.
  - **Noise** ← all `sacred-noise-*` rules (road / livestock /
    infrastructure acoustic buffers).

  Each tile shows the count + top severity (blocking / warning /
  advisory), with severity-driven border colors. Below the tile strip,
  up to three violations per dimension are listed with their suggestion
  text. Footnote calls out the data sources and notes the viewshed gap.

- `apps/web/src/features/rules/SitingWarningsCard.module.css` — visual
  language mirrors the §9 sibling cards but borrows the severity palette
  (red / amber / blue) instead of palette-as-domain, since this card's
  job is to surface alarm rather than to organize a rollup by type.

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/EducationalAtlasDashboard.tsx`
  — mounted `<SitingWarningsCard project={project} />` between the §9
  GatheringRetreatCard and the P4 Guided Walkthrough stub. The card
  fits the dashboard's "explain the design" framing: it answers the
  steward question "where is this design exposed?" alongside the
  rationale index that answers "why this feature, here?"
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` line 255 — flipped the §5
  status `planned → done`.

### Decisions
- *Why this dashboard, not SiteIntelligencePanel?* SitingWarningsCard
  reads from feature stores (placed structures / paddocks / zones), not
  from the layer fetch result. The Educational Atlas dashboard already
  frames placement decisions narratively; the panel-side
  SiteIntelligence surface is layer-data heavy and would dilute focus.
- *Why not extend SitingPanel?* SitingPanel already shows all violations
  with weight sliders and rule catalog. The §5 spec asks for a *focused
  rollup*, not another all-categories list — the value is the framing.
- *Honest "view" gap.* Rendering a "View — 0" tile would imply the
  check ran. Showing it explicitly as "Not yet evaluated" tells the
  steward "we have not looked yet", which is more useful and primes the
  spec for a future viewshed rule.

### Verified
- `tsc --noEmit` from `apps/web` clean (only pre-existing MapView errors
  unrelated to this change).
- Type-checked specifically `SitingWarningsCard.tsx` and
  `EducationalAtlasDashboard.tsx` — zero errors in touched files.

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas §9 — gathering & retreat capacity rollup

Closed §9 `tent-glamping-gathering-firecircle-lookout` (P2, planned →
done) on the manifest. Sibling to the SupportInfrastructureCard shipped
earlier this session — same skeleton (count / floor area / per-subtype
bar), but framed for program/people surfaces rather than operations.
Mounted on the Educational Atlas dashboard between the Rationale Index
and the P4 Guided Walkthrough stub, since these are the spaces stewards
actually program.

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/structures/GatheringRetreatCard.tsx` — pure
  presentation. Aggregates by the four §9 subtypes called out in the
  spec line: tent_glamping, pavilion (canonical "Open-air gathering
  structure"), fire_circle, lookout. Classroom is intentionally
  excluded — it lives under §9 `prayer-bathhouse-classroom-placement`.
  Totals strip shows sites count, floor area (m²), and a heuristic
  seating-capacity total derived from per-subtype defaults (40/pavilion,
  16/fire_circle, 4/lookout, 2/tent). Per-subtype rows render a warm-
  amber floor-area bar (distinguishes "program/people" from the sage-
  green "operations/things" palette of SupportInfrastructureCard) and
  per-instance meta line.
- `apps/web/src/features/structures/GatheringRetreatCard.module.css`
  — visual language mirrors SupportInfrastructureCard with an amber
  gradient swap.

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/EducationalAtlasDashboard.tsx`
  — imported `GatheringRetreatCard`, mounted between the Rationale
  Index card and the Guided Walkthrough P4-stub card.
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts:253` — `tent-glamping-
  gathering-firecircle-lookout` planned → done.

### Untouched
StructureStore types (already correct), DesignToolsPanel picker (already
exposes the four subtypes via the existing 'gathering' category
iteration), shared scoring (no math changes), persist version (no shape
changes), classroom-bearing §9 prayer-bathhouse-classroom row.

### Verification
`NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit` from
`apps/web` exits clean. Pre-existing MapView.tsx errors from a parallel
session's uncommitted work (`rightPanelCollapsed`,
`RailPanelShellProps`) are unrelated and not addressed here.

## [2026-04-24] session | MILOS shared UI motif tokens

Extracted five reusable UI motifs from per-page CSS into a shared
`--motif-*` namespace in `src/styles/tokens.css`, then composed them on
two initial consumers (Prophetic Path active card + MaqasidBalanceRadar).
Closes the "cross-module rhythm" (Q5) ask from the FLO consult: halo,
ghost-text, soft-glass, shimmer-border, and editorial-serif are now one
vocabulary instead of duplicated per page.

### Motifs

- **soft-glass** — parchment-ish surface with 1px border + inset
  highlight; consumer scope sets `--motif-tint`.
- **shimmer-border** — 4s linear gradient sweep using mask composite;
  tint-driven, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **ghost-text** — recede-via-`color-mix()` formula for past/upcoming
  summary rows (not locked content — still selectable).
- **halo** — two-layer box-shadow, tint-driven; consumer controls
  intensity via `--motif-tint-strength` fallback chain.
- **editorial serif** — `--font-serif` at weight 400 with tightened
  letter-spacing for hero-scale moments that carry gravitas through
  size + air, not weight.

### Consumers

- `PropheticPath.jsx/.css` — active prayer card promoted to soft-glass +
  shimmer-border surface with editorial-serif title; new
  `pp-intro__header` stack (eyebrow → hero → bookends) with city name
  and Fajr/Maghrib bookends.
- `MaqasidBalanceRadar.jsx` — viewBox horizontal padding bump (+60px
  each side) so left/right axis labels don't clip.

### Wiki

- `wiki/concepts/motif-tokens.md` — concept page explaining the token
  vocabulary + fallback chain (`--motif-tint` → `--level-color` →
  `--pillar-accent`).
- `wiki/decisions/2026-04-24-milos-ui-motif-tokens.md` — architectural
  decision record.
- `wiki/index.md` — catalog entry under Concepts.

### Why not a component library

Tokens + utility classes, not CSS-in-JS or a fourth abstraction layer —
because the per-page JSX already knows its own structure and just needs
a shared substrate. A page can set `--motif-tint` locally to express its
accent; the motif applies its geometry.

---

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas §9 — support-infrastructure rollup card

Closed §9 `storage-shelter-compost-pumphouse-placement` (P2, planned →
done) on the manifest. The four structure subtypes (storage, animal_shelter,
compost_station, water_pump_house) already existed in `StructureType` with
full footprint definitions in `features/structures/footprints.ts`, and the
Design Tools structure picker already exposed them via the existing
category iteration. The missing piece was a read-side rollup so stewards
can see "what support infrastructure have we placed" at a glance —
shipped as a self-contained card mounted on the Utilities & Infrastructure
dashboard (the `infrastructure-utilities` route → `EnergyDashboard
focus="infrastructure"`).

### Added
- `apps/web/src/features/structures/SupportInfrastructureCard.tsx` — pure
  presentation. Aggregates by the four §9 subtypes: count, total floor
  area (width × depth), and cost-range total (steward-entered estimate
  when set, else template `costRange` low/high). Renders empty-state
  prompt when none placed; otherwise totals strip + per-subtype rows
  with a sage-green floor-area bar (normalized against the largest
  bucket) and per-subtype meta line.
- `apps/web/src/features/structures/SupportInfrastructureCard.module.css`
  — visual language mirrors the existing `.card` / `.cardHead` pattern in
  EnergyDashboard.module.css so the card reads as a sibling.

### Changed
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/EnergyDashboard.tsx` — imported
  `SupportInfrastructureCard`, mounted between Placed Utilities and
  Dependency Warnings, gated on `!isEnergy` so it appears only on the
  infrastructure focus.
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts:252` — `storage-shelter-compost-
  pumphouse-placement` planned → done.

### Untouched
StructureStore types (already correct), DesignToolsPanel picker (already
exposes the four subtypes), shared scoring (no math changes), persist
version (no shape changes).

### Verification
`NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit` from
`apps/web` exits clean. No new shared exports, no migrations, no map
layer additions.

## [2026-04-24] session | OGDEN sub-pillar rename: Maqasid → MILOS

Renamed the middle OGDEN Ecosystem sub-pillar from **Maqasid** to **MILOS**
to eliminate semantic collision with the *Maqasid al-Shariah* framework
(the 7 pillars MILOS implements). Full rename across visible labels,
internal ids, route, store board ids, module entry, page file, wiki entity
page.

### Changed
- `src/data/ogden-ecosystem.js` — `OGDEN_SUB_PILLARS` id/label/route/glossaryId;
  `OGDEN_MODULE_ID` key+value.
- `src/data/modules.js` — `ogden-maqasid` entry → `ogden-milos`.
- `src/store/project-store.js` — `OGDEN_BOARDS` 3 entries re-keyed to
  `ogden_milos_{core,growth,excellence}`; board names `MAQASID — …` →
  `MILOS — …`; `moduleId: 'milos'`.
- `src/data/pillar-wisdom.js` + `pillar-next-actions.js` — key `ogden.maqasid`
  → `ogden.milos`.
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx` — `MODULE_ROUTES['ogden-milos']`,
  `OGDEN_SIDEBAR_CHILDREN` id `ogden-milos`.
- `src/App.jsx` — import + `<Route path="ogden-milos">`.
- `src/pages/ogden/OgdenMaqasidPage.jsx` → `OgdenMilosPage.jsx` (component
  `OgdenMilosPage`, `pillarKey="milos"`).
- `src/pages/ogden/OgdenPillarPage.jsx` — `OGDEN_PILLAR_MODULE_MAP.milos`.
- `src/pages/ogden/CONTEXT.md` + `wiki/entities/ogden-ecosystem.md` — table
  rows, routes, deferred list.

### Untouched (framework, not sub-pillar)
`MaqasidComparisonWheel`, `MaqasidTable`, `MaqasidBalanceRadar`,
`MAQASID_PILLARS`, `--pillar-*` tokens, all 7-pillar pages. These refer to
the Maqasid al-Shariah framework and are orthogonal to the OGDEN sub-pillar
name.

### Accepted cost
Any stored `ogden_maqasid_*` board data in localStorage is orphaned on
reload. OGDEN scaffold shipped this same session with no accumulated
operator progress, so reseeding is trivial.

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas corridor friction: cover × impedance raster

Second revision of the §7 biodiversity corridor — replaced the
intervention-only friction proxy with a **zone-polygonized land-cover ×
impedance surface** grounded in Circuitscape / Omniscape / Theobald 2013
connectivity defaults.

### Done
- `SoilRegenerationProcessor` now emits `coverClass` + `disturbanceLevel`
  on each `soil_regeneration` feature. The per-zone `LandCoverZone` was
  already computed inside `loadContext` from the `land_cover` layer's
  class-distribution summary; exposing it 1:1 onto the grid gives the
  overlay a zone-level cover raster for free (no new adapter work).
- New `frictionForCell({ intervention, coverClass, disturbanceLevel })`
  in `@ogden/shared/ecology/corridorLCP`. Cover impedance table:
  forest/wetland = 1, shrubland = 2, grassland = 3, pasture = 4,
  cropland = 7, barren = 8, water = 12, urban = 15, unknown = 5.
  Scaled by `1 + 0.4 × disturbanceLevel` and discounted for permeable
  interventions (food-forest / silvopasture × 0.7, cover crop × 0.9).
  Clamped to [1, 20]. Falls back to `frictionForIntervention` when
  `coverClass` is null so pre-upgrade features still route.
- `BiodiversityCorridorOverlay` reads the two new props and calls
  `frictionForCell` instead of the legacy proxy.
- 20/20 vitest pass on `corridorLCP.test.ts` (added 8 cases: synonym
  normalization, cover-dominates-intervention, intervention discount,
  disturbance scaling, fallback, clamp, impedance ranking, cover-aware
  routing around cropland through forest).

### Verification
- `npx tsc -b packages/shared` clean.
- `npx tsc -b apps/api` clean.
- `apps/web` tsc unchanged — `PlantingToolDashboard.tsx` errors are
  pre-existing working-tree state on the branch.
- Scoring parity untouched by design (no edits to `computeScores.ts`;
  `SoilRegenerationProcessor` change is additive property emission).

### Deferred
True pixel-scale friction raster (vs zone-polygonized), Steiner-tree
multi-anchor corridors, regional-plant lists, cross-parcel stitching.
`native-pollinator-biodiversity` stays `partial` on the manifest.

### Wiki
- `atlas/apps/web/src/features/soil-ecology/CONTEXT.md` — pollinator
  three-wave gotcha rewritten with the new cover × impedance model.
- `wiki/entities/olos.md` — `(corridor LCP)` paragraph amended.

---

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas §15 phase completion + §13 utility status-sweep

Manifest gap-fill pass continued. Two flips shipped this session.

### Done
- §15 `phase-completion-tracking-notes` `partial → done`: extended
  `BuildPhase` with `completed/notes/completedAt`, added
  `togglePhaseCompleted`, bumped store v1 → v2 with migration. Phasing
  dashboard gets a Completion progress bar in the Arc summary, per-phase
  checkbox + completed-at badge, and working-notes textarea. Three
  financial-engine test fixtures updated for the new required fields.
- §13 batch sweep: 8 utility manifest entries `partial → done` after
  confirming `UtilityPanel` covers every `UtilityType` with persistence
  and phasing (solar/battery/generator placement, water/well/greywater,
  blackwater/septic, rain catchment/corridor/lighting, firewood/waste/
  compost/biochar, tool/laundry, utility phasing, off-grid readiness).
  `energy-demand-notes` left `planned` — needs a per-utility demand
  field not yet on `Utility`.

### Verification
`apps/web` tsc clean across all files touched today. Pre-existing
`PlantingToolDashboard.tsx` errors are unchanged working-tree state.

### Atlas decision / wiki
- `atlas/wiki/decisions/2026-04-24-phasing-completion-tracking-and-utility-status-sweep.md`
- `atlas/wiki/log.md` entry prepended

### Recommended next
- `energy-demand-notes` (§13): add `demandKwhPerDay?` to `Utility`.
- `infrastructure-cost-placeholder-per-structure` (§9): verify per-
  structure cost-edit UI end-to-end.
- `temporary-vs-permanent-seasonal` (§15): boolean + filter UI.

---

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas §7 pollinator close — ecoregion adapter + patch-graph corridor

Objective (continuation): "update wiki, commit, resume the soil-ecology §7 pollinator work (connectivity corridors, ecoregion plant-list adapter, pollinator-zone map overlay) to flip native-pollinator-biodiversity from partial → done."

### Done
- Shared: new `ecology/ecoregion.ts` (CEC Level III, 7 ecoregions, bbox→centroid lookup) + curated plant JSON (~150 species). `pollinatorHabitat` upgraded to consume `ecoregionId` + `corridorReadiness`; outputs add `ecoregion`, `ecoregionPlants`, `connectivityBand`. New `pollinator_opportunity` LayerType + summary shape.
- API: new `PollinatorOpportunityProcessor` — 5×5 deterministic synthesized patch grid, 4-neighbor patch-graph connectivity, `corridorReadiness` index. Wired into `DataPipelineOrchestrator` as non-fatal enrichment after soil-regen.
- Web: `PollinatorHabitatOverlay` rewritten to read the new layer directly; fill = habitat quality, stroke = connectivity role. `EcologicalDashboard` now shows Corridor Connectivity metric, CEC ecoregion strip, and recommended native species cards.
- Manifest: §7 `native-pollinator-biodiversity` flipped `partial → done`.
- Parity: `verify-scoring-parity.ts` determinism check passes; pollinator is read-side only so `computeScores.ts` was not touched.

### Deferred (documented caveats)
- Rigorous corridor analysis needs polygonized land cover + raster LCP.
- Ecoregion lookup uses bbox+centroid, not full shapefiles — boundary points misclassify.

### Atlas decision / wiki
- `atlas/wiki/decisions/2026-04-24-atlas-pollinator-ecoregion-corridor.md`
- `atlas/wiki/entities/shared-package.md` + `data-pipeline.md` updated
- `atlas/wiki/log.md` entry prepended

### Recommended next
- Ingest polygonized land cover to enable real patch graphs.
- Expand ecoregion coverage west / south as the pilot footprint grows.

---

## [2026-04-24] session | OGDEN Ecosystem meta-module scaffolded

Objective: add a MILOS surface that tracks the convergence of BBOS + MILOS + Atlas into Moontrance. Scaffolding-only — journey task content deferred.

### Done
- `src/data/ogden-ecosystem.js` — `OGDEN_SUB_PILLARS` (bbos, maqasid, atlas), `OGDEN_LEVEL_ROUTES`, `OGDEN_LEVELS` (custom `Foundation/Integration/Realization` display copy over internal `core/growth/excellence` keys), `OGDEN_ACCENT = '#7E6EAD'`, `OGDEN_STORAGE_KEY`, `OGDEN_ENSURE_PROJECTS`.
- `src/data/modules.js` — 3 new entries: `ogden-bbos` (Briefcase), `ogden-maqasid` (Compass), `ogden-atlas` (Globe2).
- `src/data/icon-registry.js` — registered `Orbit`, `Briefcase`, `Globe2`.
- `src/data/module-palette.js` — `ogden` palette entry with `#7E6EAD` theme.
- `src/store/project-store.js` — `OGDEN_BOARDS` (9 boards: 3 sub-pillars × 3 levels, id pattern `ogden_{pillar}_{level}`) + `ensureOgdenProjects` action mirroring the Faith/Ummah pattern (backfill moduleId, idempotent seed).
- `src/pages/ogden/` — `OgdenLevelOverview` (wraps shared `LevelOverviewPage`, `boardPrefix="ogden"`, passes `levelDescriptions={OGDEN_LEVELS}`, no comparison wheel in v1), `OgdenFoundationPage` / `OgdenIntegrationPage` / `OgdenRealizationPage` (tier wrappers), `OgdenPillarPage` (wraps shared `PillarLevelPage` with identity pillar→moduleId map), `OgdenBbosPage` / `OgdenMaqasidPage` / `OgdenAtlasPage` (sub-pillar routes), plus `CONTEXT.md`.
- `src/App.jsx` — 6 routes registered after `moontrance-residency`: `ogden-foundation`, `ogden-integration`, `ogden-realization`, `ogden-bbos`, `ogden-maqasid`, `ogden-atlas`. No CeremonyGuard — OGDEN is not a Maqasid pillar.
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx` — 3 new `MODULE_ROUTES` entries + a standalone `<div className="pillar-group">` rendered after the `MAQASID_PILLARS.map()` loop. Orbit icon, indigo accent, 3 children; header click navigates to `/app/ogden-foundation`; expand/collapse via `togglePillar('ogden')`.
- `wiki/entities/ogden-ecosystem.md` + `wiki/index.md` catalog row.
- `src/pages/CONTEXT.md` updated with `ogden/` row.

### Design discipline
- **Not a Maqasid pillar.** Rendered as a sibling group below the `MAQASID_PILLARS` loop to preserve the taxonomy.
- **No LevelNavigator changes needed.** Discovered `LevelOverviewPage` already threads `levelDescriptions` through the shared `LevelNavigator` (`baseLevels.map(l => ({ ...l, ...levelDescriptions[l.key] }))` at `LevelNavigator.jsx:159`), so the plan's Phase 2 was skipped entirely.
- **MaqasidComparisonWheel not reused.** Hardcoded to 8 Maqasid lobes; reusing it for 3 OGDEN sub-pillars would misrepresent the data. A 3-lobe variant is deferred.

### Deferred
- Journey task seeding for all 9 boards (empty by design for v1).
- 3-lobe `OgdenEcosystemWheel` variant.
- `ExcellenceCardsComponent` equivalent.
- Glossary entries for `ogden-bbos` / `ogden-maqasid` / `ogden-atlas`.

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas §7 — biodiversity corridor (least-cost-path) overlay

Objective: close the "biodiversity corridor planning" clause inside `native-pollinator-biodiversity`'s manifest label (§7) by shipping a least-cost-path corridor tool on the existing `soil_regeneration` grid. Keep status at `partial` — friction model is a planning proxy, not a real habitat-friction raster.

### Done
- `packages/shared/src/ecology/corridorLCP.ts` — pure Dijkstra over an 8-connected grid reconstructed from `zoneId` + `totalZones` (mirrors `SoilRegenerationProcessor.zoneIndexToCentroid` exactly so client corridors land on the same centroids the server writes). Exports `frictionForIntervention`, `gridDims`, `zoneCentroid`, `pickCorridorAnchors`, `dijkstraLCP`, `computeCorridor`, plus `CorridorInput` / `CorridorResult` / `ZoneInput` / `InterventionType` types. Anchor pick: two farthest-apart cells with `primaryIntervention ∈ {food_forest_candidate, silvopasture_candidate}`; returns null when fewer than two or when they are not at least ~35% of grid diagonal apart.
- `packages/shared/src/tests/corridorLCP.test.ts` — 12 vitest cases: friction ranking, grid reconstruction, centroid formula parity, straight path, √2 diagonal preference, obstacle detour, source==sink short-circuit, anchor pairing correctness, null cases (no high-band, too few zones). All green.
- `packages/shared/src/index.ts` — re-exports `./ecology/corridorLCP.js`.
- `apps/web/src/features/map/BiodiversityCorridorOverlay.tsx` — canonical overlay. Reads the `soil_regeneration` layer, derives a zone-to-coord map directly from feature geometries (no bbox round-trip needed), runs Dijkstra, and paints three sources: a 50 m `turf.buffer`-ed corridor band (`fill`), the LCP polyline (`line`), and the two anchor dots (`circle`). Color: `#6ba47a` band at 0.28α, `#4f7f5a` line at 0.9α. Silently paints nothing when substrate is missing (layer unmaterialized, fewer than 4 zones, or no viable anchors).
- `apps/web/src/features/map/BiodiversityCorridorOverlay.tsx` toggle (Lucide `Waypoints`) — `Biodiversity corridor` tooltip; aria-label `Toggle biodiversity corridor overlay`.
- `apps/web/src/store/mapStore.ts` — `biodiversityCorridorVisible` / `setBiodiversityCorridorVisible`, default false.
- `apps/web/src/features/map/LeftToolSpine.tsx` — new `biodiversityCorridorSlot` rendered immediately after `pollinatorOpportunitySlot`.
- `apps/web/src/features/map/MapView.tsx` — lazy imports, spine slot wiring, overlay mounted alongside sibling §7 overlays after `PollinatorHabitatOverlay`.
- `apps/web/src/features/soil-ecology/CONTEXT.md` — `native-pollinator-biodiversity` entry rewritten as three-wave (dashboard synthesis + opportunity overlay + corridor LCP) with an honest deferred list.

### Scope discipline
- **No new server work.** All three corridor inputs (`zoneId`, `primaryIntervention`, centroid coords) already live on the `soil_regeneration` layer.
- **Manifest stays `partial`.** The overlay closes the "biodiversity corridor *planning*" clause of the item label but the friction model is an intervention-type proxy, not a true habitat-friction raster. Still deferred: Steiner-tree multi-anchor corridors, region-specific plant lists, current-state habitat raster, cross-parcel corridors (`multi-property-corridor-planning`, FUTURE).
- **Parity untouched.** `computeScores.ts` is unchanged; determinism check passes; `verify-scoring-parity.ts` unchanged.
- **Grid math kept in lockstep.** `zoneCentroid()` in `corridorLCP.ts` is a literal copy of `zoneIndexToCentroid()` in `SoilRegenerationProcessor.ts`; both are unit-tested against each other's expected output.

### Deferred (next ticket)
- Real habitat-friction raster (e.g. polygonized land cover × impedance table).
- Steiner-tree / multi-pair corridors for networks rather than single LCP.
- User-draggable anchors + click-to-inspect cell.
- Cross-parcel corridor planning (maps to FUTURE-phase `multi-property-corridor-planning`).

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas §7 — pollinator planting opportunity map overlay

Objective: close the map-overlay gap in `native-pollinator-biodiversity` (§7) without inflating scope. Leave status at `partial` — corridor connectivity + region-specific plant lists remain genuine gaps.

### Done
- `apps/web/src/features/map/PollinatorHabitatOverlay.tsx` — classed-circle overlay over the `soil_regeneration` FeatureCollection. Derives a `pollinatorBand` from `primaryIntervention` (silvopasture/food-forest → high, cover-crop → moderate, mulch/compost → low) and paints cells keyed on that discriminator. Mirrors the canonical `RestorationPriorityOverlay` (fetch-on-visible + style.load re-sync + overlayOpacity respect). Lucide Flower-2 signifier on the compact spine toggle; "Pollinator" label on the non-compact variant.
- `apps/web/src/store/mapStore.ts` — new `pollinatorOpportunityVisible` / `setPollinatorOpportunityVisible` keys; default `false`.
- `apps/web/src/features/map/LeftToolSpine.tsx` — new `pollinatorOpportunitySlot` rendered immediately after `agroforestrySlot`.
- `apps/web/src/features/map/MapView.tsx` — lazy-imports `PollinatorHabitatOverlay` + `PollinatorHabitatToggle`, wires the spine slot, and mounts the overlay alongside the sibling §7 overlays.
- `apps/web/src/features/soil-ecology/CONTEXT.md` — `native-pollinator-biodiversity` entry rewritten as two-wave (dashboard synthesis + map overlay), with the *opportunity vs. current habitat* distinction called out explicitly so future contributors don't overclaim.

### Scope discipline
- **No new server work.** The overlay is a pure client-side filter/transform on `soil_regeneration`, same pattern as `MulchCompostCovercropOverlay` / `AgroforestryOverlay`.
- **Manifest stays `partial`.** The overlay closes one of three gaps; corridor connectivity (needs least-cost-path on habitat-friction raster) and region-specific plant lists (needs USDA PLANTS + ecoregion adapter) still prevent `done`. A current-state habitat-quality raster (needs polygonized NLCD) is a fourth latent gap.
- **Parity untouched.** `verify-scoring-parity.ts` is unchanged; `computeScores.ts` is unchanged; determinism check passes.
- **Framing.** Toggle label + tooltip deliberately say "Pollinator planting *opportunity*" — the overlay paints where the land *wants* pollinator plantings (per the intervention classifier), not where they currently exist.

### Deferred (next ticket)
- Popup / click-through on circles (no sibling overlay has one yet).
- Cross-site corridor connectivity (needs substrate).
- Region-specific plant adapter.

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas §7 — regeneration_events substrate (migration 015 + shared schema)

Objective: design and ship the `regeneration_events` table + Zod schema that §7's intervention-log / stage-tagging / before-after-compare items are blocked on. This session lays substrate only — API routes + UI are deferred.

### Done
- **Migration** `apps/api/src/db/migrations/015_regeneration_events.sql` — single-table design carrying three concerns (intervention log, stage tagging, before/after pairs). Columns:
  - `event_type` (observation | intervention | milestone | photo)
  - `intervention_type` — mirrors `InterventionType` from `soilRegeneration.ts` + `other`
  - `phase` — mirrors `SequencePhase` from `soilRegeneration.ts`
  - `progress` (planned | in_progress | completed | observed)
  - `title`, `notes`, `event_date`
  - `location geometry(Geometry, 4326)` — Point OR Polygon OR NULL (site-wide)
  - `area_ha`, `observations jsonb`, `media_urls text[]`
  - `parent_event_id` self-FK ON DELETE SET NULL for before/after pairs
  - CHECK constraints on all four enums (DB boundary) — match Zod character-for-character
  - GIST index on location, btree indexes on (project_id), (project_id, event_date DESC), (project_id, intervention_type WHERE NOT NULL), (parent_event_id WHERE NOT NULL)
- **Shared schema** `packages/shared/src/schemas/regenerationEvent.schema.ts` — `RegenerationEvent` (stored record), `RegenerationEventInput` (create payload), `RegenerationEventUpdateInput`, plus the four enum z.enum exports. Location schema accepts GeoJSON Point or Polygon.
- **Shared export** — re-exported from `packages/shared/src/index.ts`.
- **CONTEXT.md** §7 — gotcha rewritten: events now persist in `regeneration_events`; pointed at the migration + shared schema; flagged the two-boundary sync rule.

### Decisions (worth remembering)
- **One table, not three.** Splitting intervention / observation / milestone would force cross-table joins for every timeline query. Discriminator column + CHECK beats 3× surface area.
- **No FK to `project_layers`.** Tier-3 runs replace prior `soil_regeneration` rows on recompute; hard-linking an event would orphan. When zone pairing is needed, copy the integer `zoneId` into `observations.zoneId`.
- **CHECK at DB + Zod at API.** Dual boundary validation. If TS enum changes, update both.
- **Manifest stays `planned`.** Migration + schema alone don't close `regen-stage-intervention-log` — honest accounting. API routes + UI in a future session.

### Verified
- `trigger_set_updated_at()` function confirmed present in migration 001 before referencing.
- `tsc -b packages/shared` clean.

### Deferred (explicitly NOT in this session)
- API routes (POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE `/api/v1/projects/:id/regeneration-events`)
- UI: timeline list, event-create form, before/after compare pane
- Media upload plumbing (media_urls is just a pointer array)

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas §7 P2 close — intervention & agroforestry overlays

Objective: close the remaining two §7 P2 ecology items — `mulching-compost-covercrop-zones` and `silvopasture-foodforest-regen-zones` — both `planned` coming in.

### Orientation finding
`SoilRegenerationProcessor` already emits each feature with `properties.primaryIntervention` ∈ {mulching_priority, compost_application, cover_crop_candidate, silvopasture_candidate, food_forest_candidate}. No new server processor needed — both manifest items reduce to client-side filter + paint overlays against the existing `soil_regeneration` layer.

### Done
- **MulchCompostCovercropOverlay** — filters `soil_regeneration` FeatureCollection to the three surface-intervention classes and paints classed circles (mulching=#b59a6e straw, compost=#6b4f3a humus, cover_crop=#7fb98a young-legume green). Lucide `Leaf` spine icon. Store key: `mulchCovercropVisible`.
- **AgroforestryOverlay** — filters to silvopasture + food_forest classes (silvopasture=#4a8f4e, food_forest=#2e7a4a). Lucide `TreePine` spine icon. Store key: `agroforestryVisible`.
- **Store**: added paired state/setters to `mapStore.ts` next to `restorationPriorityVisible`.
- **LeftToolSpine**: new `mulchCovercropSlot` + `agroforestrySlot` props rendered below `restorationSlot` in the analysis group.
- **MapView**: lazy-imported both overlays + both toggles, wired the two new slots and the two new overlay mounts.
- **Manifest**: both items flipped `planned` → `done`.
- **CONTEXT.md**: §7 `soil-ecology/CONTEXT.md` captures the two new overlays and an honest caveat — manifest label names "forest regeneration" as a distinct class but the processor folds it into food-forest; do not fake a separate legend entry.

### Verified
- `tsc --noEmit` in `apps/web` clean (`NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=6144`).
- Vite HMR accepted `MapView.tsx` cleanly across every edit.

### Deferred
- Live browser click-through on the spine buttons — preview lands on the marketing home page; the buttons live in the authenticated MapView.
- Distinct `forest_regeneration` intervention type in `SoilRegenerationProcessor` — would let `AgroforestryOverlay` paint a third class per the manifest label. Tracked as a future server-side enhancement.

---

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas §7 P2 close — restoration priority map overlay

Objective: flip `soil-restoration-opportunity-map` from `partial` → `done` by painting `SoilRegenerationProcessor` zones on the main Mapbox map (shape mirrors this week's §6 `MicroclimateOverlay`).

### Done
- **New overlay** `apps/web/src/features/map/RestorationPriorityOverlay.tsx` — reads `soil_regeneration` project layer via `api.layers.get`, renders Point centroids as classed circles (fill + stroke) keyed on `properties.priorityClass` (critical #c04a3a → high #d68a4e → moderate #d4c564 → low #6ba47a, matching the microclimate risk ramp). Circle radius interpolates by zoom (4px@z10 → 18px@z18). Fetch-on-visible + `style.load` re-sync pattern, same as Microclimate/Viewshed overlays.
- **Spine toggle** `RestorationPriorityToggle` (Lucide Sprout icon) wired into `LeftToolSpine` via new `restorationSlot` prop, mounted in `MapView` below the windbreak slot.
- **Store** `useMapStore.restorationPriorityVisible` + `setRestorationPriorityVisible` added next to `windbreakVisible`.
- **Manifest**: `soil-restoration-opportunity-map` flipped `partial` → `done` in `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts`.
- **CONTEXT.md**: §7 `soil-ecology/CONTEXT.md` restoration-priority bullet updated to name the overlay + store key.

### Verified
- `tsc --noEmit` in `apps/web` clean (with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=6144`).
- Preview running but lands on the marketing home page — the spine button lives inside the authenticated MapView, so no browser click-through this session. No runtime console errors after reload.

### Deferred
- **Live map click-through** — needs a logged-in session against a project that has a Tier-3 `soil_regeneration` layer materialised to see the circles paint. Shape parity with MicroclimateOverlay is the only verification gate taken.

---

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas §7 P1 close — soil observations round-trip

Objective: lift the two §7 P1 items (`soil-type-drainage-ssurgo`, `ph-organic-compaction-notes`) from `partial` → `done` on the feature manifest.

### Orientation findings (substrate was far more built than §7 CONTEXT.md claimed)
- `apps/web/src/features/map/SoilOverlay.tsx` already ships a SoilGrids v2.0 raster overlay (MapLibre canvas source, property picker, colour-ramp legend, hover tooltip) — mounted in `MapView`.
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/EcologicalDashboard.tsx` already ships a comprehensive soil health card (pH, OM, drainage, texture, bedrock, canopy, extended physical/chemical/particle properties, fertility index, salinization risk, soil flags) plus wetlands, land cover, interventions, carbon sequestration, opportunities. Mounted in `DashboardRouter`.
- Real gap: no dedicated structured capture for user-entered pH/OM/compaction/biology observations in the intake wizard — everything was routed through a generic `fieldObservations` free-text field.

### Done
- **Shared schema**: new `SoilNotes` Zod object in `packages/shared/src/schemas/project.schema.ts` (ph, organicMatter, compaction, biologicalActivity — all optional, free-text). Added to `ProjectMetadata` as `soilNotes?: SoilNotes`.
- **Wizard capture**: `StepNotes.tsx` now has a dedicated SOIL OBSERVATIONS form group (pH + OM as short inputs, compaction + biological activity as 2-line textareas). Values packed into `projects.metadata.soilNotes` via `buildMetadata()`.
- **Client persistence**: `LocalProject` extended with `metadata?: ProjectMetadata`; `createProject` now carries `input.metadata` into the local store so the dashboard can read it without waiting for a server round-trip.
- **Dashboard surface**: `EcologicalDashboard.tsx` SOIL HEALTH section now renders a FIELD OBSERVATIONS subsection reading `project.metadata?.soilNotes`, rendered alongside the SSURGO/SoilGrids-derived values. Clearly labelled as user-entered so designers don't confuse it with adapter output.
- **Manifest**: flipped `soil-type-drainage-ssurgo` and `ph-organic-compaction-notes` from `partial` → `done`. Restoration-priority map (P2) stays `partial` — intervention cards ship but a dedicated map overlay for restoration zones is not yet wired. All other §7 ecology items stay `planned`.
- **CONTEXT.md**: rewrote `apps/web/src/features/soil-ecology/CONTEXT.md` to name the real UI homes (EcologicalDashboard + SoilOverlay + wizard StepNotes) instead of implying the scaffolded folder is the canonical surface. Updated gotcha for `soilNotes` jsonb shape.

### Verified
- `tsc -b packages/shared` clean.
- `tsc --noEmit` in `apps/web` clean (needed `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=6144` to avoid OOM on the Windows box; not a code issue).

### Deferred
- **Browser verification** — Atlas dev server not running; no UI click-through this session. Shape parity with `StepNotes` / `EcologicalDashboard` sibling sections is the only verification gate.
- **Restoration-priority map overlay** — `SoilRegenerationProcessor` output surfaces as intervention cards on the dashboard but does not yet paint zones on the main map. Kept P2 `soil-restoration-opportunity-map` as `partial`.
- **Soil notes round-trip to server** — client-side soilNotes flow is complete; server-side `projects.metadata` jsonb column already accepts the shape (migration 012), no new migration needed. Confirm end-to-end with a real wizard run before claiming full round-trip.

### Files touched
- `packages/shared/src/schemas/project.schema.ts` — add `SoilNotes`, extend `ProjectMetadata`
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` — two items `partial` → `done`
- `apps/web/src/features/project/wizard/StepNotes.tsx` — SOIL OBSERVATIONS form + `buildMetadata()` pack
- `apps/web/src/pages/NewProjectPage.tsx` — WizardData + INITIAL_DATA for the four new fields
- `apps/web/src/store/projectStore.ts` — `metadata?: ProjectMetadata` on `LocalProject`, carried through `createProject`
- `apps/web/src/features/dashboard/pages/EcologicalDashboard.tsx` — FIELD OBSERVATIONS subsection
- `apps/web/src/features/soil-ecology/CONTEXT.md` — honest UI map, updated gotcha

### Session Debrief
Completed: §7 P1 closeout — two manifest items `done`, user soil observations captured and displayed, CONTEXT re-grounded to reality.
Deferred: restoration-priority map overlay (P2 still `partial`); browser verification.
Recommended Next Session: one of — (a) §7 P2 restoration-priority map overlay to close `soil-restoration-opportunity-map`; (b) §8 Zoning & Functional Allocation P1 closeout; (c) §9 Structures obstacle model (unblocks deferred §6 windbreak-ventilation + §7 ecology items).

---

## [2026-04-24] session | Atlas §6 Phase 4 — microclimate, comfort map, windbreak main-map overlays

Objective: finish the three deferred §6 Climate Analysis items (microclimate opportunity map overlay, comfort map overlay, windbreak lines on main Mapbox map) so the section can flip from `partial` → `done` on the feature manifest.

### Done
- **Microclimate opportunity overlay** (~320 LOC): new `apps/web/src/features/map/MicroclimateOverlay.tsx` mirrors the `ViewshedOverlay` pattern — fetches the `microclimate` project layer via `api.layers.get(projectId, 'microclimate')`, paints a classed Mapbox fill keyed on `properties.class` with a 13-branch match expression (sun_trap → amber, wind_sheltered → forest green, moisture bands blue→sand, frost-risk green→red gradient, comfort green→grey). `MicroclimateToggle` added to the left tool spine via a new `microclimateSlot` prop on `LeftToolSpine`. Added `microclimateVisible` + setter to `mapStore`.
- **Comfort map overlay** (~450 LOC, full vertical slice):
  - Shared math: `packages/shared/src/climate/comfortGrid.ts` with `computeCellComfort`, `buildComfortBaseClimate`, `COMFORT_BAND_CODES`. Applies -6.5 °C / 1000 m adiabatic lapse vs parcel centroid + ±2 °C solar-exposure bias, classifies cells using the same `classifyMonthComfort` thresholds as the monthly calendar strip for visual parity.
  - API: `apps/api/src/services/terrain/ComfortExposureService.ts` reads DEM + per-cell slope/aspect/exposure, pulls `_monthly_normals` from the `climate` project layer, classifies cells, returns classified GeoJSON + band-area summary. Route `POST /api/v1/climate-analysis/:projectId/comfort-grid/compute` in `apps/api/src/routes/climate-analysis/index.ts`. Proper `NO_BOUNDARY` / `NO_CLIMATE_NORMALS` error codes.
  - Web: `apiClient.climateAnalysis.computeComfortGrid` + `ComfortGridResponse` type. New COMFORT EXPOSURE MAP section on `SolarClimateDashboard.tsx` with pre-flight guards (requires boundary AND normals), 8 metrics (dominant band, reference elev/mean-max/mean-min, per-band pct), and `ComfortMiniMap` SVG using a freezing→hot colour ramp.
- **Windbreak main-map overlay** (~200 LOC): new `apps/web/src/features/map/WindbreakOverlay.tsx` — client-side only (no API). Subscribes to `useSiteData` for `climate.prevailing_wind`, computes lines via shared `buildWindbreakLines` on the parcel bbox, paints as a dashed Mapbox line layer + `line-center` symbol labels ("Windbreak 1/2/3"). Added `windbreakVisible` to `mapStore`, `windbreakSlot` to `LeftToolSpine`.
- **Manifest + CONTEXT**: flipped `seasonal-comfort-outdoor-seasonality` and `microclimate-adaptation-recommendations` from `partial` → `done`. `windbreak-ventilation-corridors` stays `partial` (cold-wind-exposure + ventilation corridors still depend on §9 obstacle model). Updated `apps/web/src/features/climate-analysis/CONTEXT.md` with honest scope.

### Verified
- `npx tsc --noEmit` / `tsc -b` across `packages/shared`, `apps/api`, `apps/web` — clean (only pre-existing `LandingPage.tsx` missing-import errors remain, untouched by this session).

### Deferred
- **Browser verification** — Atlas dev server was not running; MAQASID dev server was the only active preview. New overlays were not clicked through in a browser. Typecheck + pattern-parity with `ViewshedOverlay` (production) are the only verification gates this session.
- **Comfort map on main Mapbox map** — shipped as an inline SVG minimap on the dashboard only; a Mapbox overlay variant for the comfort grid was not wired.
- **Horizon shading / wind channelling / structure shadows** in comfort + microclimate models — intentionally out of scope until §9 Structures provides an obstacle model.

### Files touched
- `packages/shared/src/climate/comfortGrid.ts` — NEW
- `packages/shared/src/index.ts` — re-export comfortGrid
- `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts` — two items `partial` → `done`
- `apps/api/src/services/terrain/ComfortExposureService.ts` — NEW
- `apps/api/src/routes/climate-analysis/index.ts` — added `POST /comfort-grid/compute`
- `apps/web/src/lib/apiClient.ts` — `computeComfortGrid` + `ComfortGridResponse`
- `apps/web/src/features/climate/SolarClimateDashboard.tsx` — COMFORT EXPOSURE MAP section + `ComfortMiniMap` sub-component
- `apps/web/src/features/map/MicroclimateOverlay.tsx` — NEW
- `apps/web/src/features/map/WindbreakOverlay.tsx` — NEW
- `apps/web/src/features/map/MapView.tsx` — mount 3 new lazy overlays + slot props
- `apps/web/src/features/map/LeftToolSpine.tsx` — 2 new slot props
- `apps/web/src/store/mapStore.ts` — `microclimateVisible` + `windbreakVisible` state
- `apps/web/src/features/climate-analysis/CONTEXT.md` — shipped state + scope notes

### Notes
- All three overlays mirror the canonical `ViewshedOverlay` pattern: two `useEffect`s (fetch-on-visible, sync-on-data-or-visibility-change with `style.load` re-sync), `spine-btn` compact toggle, lazy-loaded in `MapView`. Copy-paste discipline keeps behaviour predictable.
- The microclimate overlay's 13-branch match expression is the only one that had to reverse-engineer backend output — verified against `MicroclimateProcessor.ts:154-163` (frost bands, comfort bands, sun trap, wind shelter all discriminate on `properties.class`).
- Comfort model is deliberately planning-grade: lapse + sun bias, no radiation balance or PMV. Documented in-file so future refinements don't accidentally load it with more precision than the inputs justify.

### Session Debrief
- **Completed:** All three deferred §6 items shipped with manifest + CONTEXT updates; typecheck clean.
- **Deferred:** Browser verification (no Atlas preview running); comfort-grid Mapbox variant; obstacle-model-dependent features gated on §9.
- **Recommended Next Session:** Either (a) Atlas browser-verify the three overlays with a live project + climate-fetched site, or (b) §9 Structures obstacle-model scaffolding so the blocked parts of windbreak-ventilation-corridors can be unblocked.

## [2026-04-23] session | Prophetic Path — Isha reorder + current-node rotation

Decision: [[2026-04-23-prophetic-path-isha-order-and-rotation]].

### Done
- Reordered `NODES` in `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx` so `isha` sits directly after `maghrib`. Canonical cycle is now `maghrib → isha → tahajjud → fajr → morning → dhuhr → midday-labor → asr`.
- Added `orderedNodes` memo that rotates `NODES` by `activeNodeId` index, pinning the current window to the top of the spine while preserving cycle order. Fallback to canonical order when `activeNodeId` is null.
- Verified in preview at 23:11 local (Isha active): spine opens on `Isha & Rest → Tahajjud → Fajr → …→ Maghrib` with correct `data-prayer-state` flags.

### Deferred
- None — scope was tightly contained to one file.

## [2026-04-22] session | Atlas Tier-3 verification — SSURGO + jsonb fixes landed

Decision: [[2026-04-22-atlas-jsonb-serialization-and-ssurgo-parse]].

### Done
- **Issue #1 — SSURGO horizon aggregation:** `SsurgoAdapter.postToSda` used `format=JSON` (no header row from SDA) while `parseSdaRows` assumed `table[0]` was column names. Every horizon field nulled out. Switched to `format=JSON+COLUMNNAME`. Rodale now returns Clarksburg silt loam (pH 6.37, OM 2.64%, 31 horizons, Fragipan @ 69cm).
- **Issue #2 — jsonb double-serialization:** 5 writers stringified objects before interpolating into postgres.js template literals, so jsonb columns stored string primitives. Replaced `${JSON.stringify(x)}` with `${this.db.json(x as never) as unknown as string}` in `DataPipelineOrchestrator.ts`, `WatershedRefinementProcessor.ts`, `SoilRegenerationProcessor.ts`, `MicroclimateProcessor.ts`, `TerrainAnalysisProcessor.ts` (14 sites in terrain alone).
- Verification on Rodale project `26b43c47-…`: `jsonb_typeof` = `object` everywhere, overall site score 50 → 78, `verify-scoring-parity.ts` exit 0 with delta 0.000, determinism PASS.

### Deferred
- `SsurgoAdapter.test.ts` fixtures include a header row and so hid the production bug. Tests don't assert real SDA wire format — add a fixture without the header row (or an integration test hitting SDA) in a future session.
- Rodale OM 2.64% is below the user's ≥3% expectation. This reflects SSURGO survey averages for the Clarksburg series, not a pipeline bug — flag for product conversation about whether to surface "long-term regenerative management" as an explicit override.

### Next session
- Hit Tier-3 in a second bioregion (Canadian project → `OmafraCanSisAdapter` + `NrcanHrdemAdapter` paths) to confirm the jsonb pattern holds through the CA fork.

---

## [2026-04-23] session | Dashboard three-tier redesign landed (Qalb / Amal / Barakah)

Decision: [[2026-04-23-dashboard-three-tier-redesign]].

### Done
- Shipped the Qalb → Amal → Barakah tier backbone on `/app/dashboard`. Three `<section className="dash-tier dash-tier--{qalb|amal|barakah}">` wrappers with bilingual eyebrows (Arabic layer gated on `valuesLayer === 'islamic'`).
- **New components:** `DailyMithaq.{jsx,css}` (morphing covenant widget — Niyyah → Muhasaba → Fulfilled, Maghrib pivot via `usePrayerTimes()` with 6pm fallback; null-gates cleanly when no niyyah is set), `MaqasidBalanceRadar.{jsx,css}` (7-axis SVG polygon, shape-only, no numeric scores — no-riya framing).
- **Dashboard.jsx lint debt cleaned** in the process: removed 6 dead vars (`completedOpening`, `deferred`, `nextPrayer`, `initials`, `greeting`, `motivation`) + their now-unused imports (`usePrayerTimes`, `getGreeting`, `getMotivation`). Scoped lint on the 3 files: zero errors.
- Orphan `ManifestoBanner.jsx` / `EveningReflectButton.jsx` verified unused (only self-referenced + a docstring in `DailyMithaq`). Left in place per user call — deferred to a future cleanup sweep.

### Verified in preview
- 3 tiers render in order with correct bilingual eyebrows.
- BCG chart, Daily Snapshot (3-metric grid), Sakinah Meter, Maqasid Balance Radar SVG all present on first paint.
- `DailyMithaq` correctly returns `null` when no niyyah is set (Qalb tier falls back to the TodayFocusSection Niyyah hero).
- Zero console errors on `/app`.

### Files
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` — three `<section>` tier wrappers, dead-var cleanup.
- `src/pages/Dashboard.css` — `.dash-tier*`, `.daily-snapshot*`, `.sakinah*` added; `.insight-eph*`, `.insight-stat-card*`, `.wf-pressure*`, `.barakah-radar-stub*` removed.
- `src/components/dashboard/DailyMithaq.{jsx,css}` — new.
- `src/components/dashboard/MaqasidBalanceRadar.{jsx,css}` — new.
- `wiki/decisions/2026-04-23-dashboard-three-tier-redesign.md` — decision doc.

### Build
✅ `npm run build` clean in 2.08s.

### Worktree discipline
Executed the whole plan in the isolated worktree at `.claude/worktrees/dashboard-three-tier` (branch `worktree-dashboard-three-tier`). Other in-progress working-tree files on `main` (TopBar, MobileNav, TodayFocusSection, PillarProgressStrip, etc.) left untouched — they belong to separate sessions.

### Notes / Deferred
- `PillarProgressStrip.jsx` working-tree edits left out of this commit per session brief — revisit when its companion session surfaces.
- Orphan `ManifestoBanner.jsx` / `EveningReflectButton.jsx` deletion deferred.
- Whole-repo lint has 631 errors (pre-existing debt across BBOS, Pillar dashboards, etc.) — out of scope here, tracked implicitly.

---

## [2026-04-23] session | Work page pillar scope + spine reorder

Two small UX fixes surfaced while testing the Prophetic Path MirrorCard Wealth+Action projects list.

### Done
- **Seed boards hidden from Work page.** `Work.jsx` filter only excluded the seven `_<pillar>Module` flags — `_weeklyModule` (from `ensureWeeklyProjects`) and `_prayerModule` (from `ensurePrayerProjects`) slipped through, so "Weekly · Wealth" / "FAJR — BEFORE" / "DHUHR — BEFORE" / "TAHAJJUD — BEFORE" etc. all appeared as user projects. Added both flags to the exclusion set.
- **Seed boards hidden from MirrorCard.** Mirrored the same fix in `prophetic-path-submodules.js` → `SEEDED_PILLAR_FLAGS`, which `buildUserProjectsForScope` consults.
- **Work page scoped to Wealth.** The `work` module only appears under the Wealth pillar in the sidebar (`MAQASID_PILLARS` in `data/maqasid.js`), so the Work page now filters to projects where `moduleId === 'wealth'` or resolves to one of the 4 Wealth submodules. Unassigned projects no longer leak in.
- **New Project dialog defaults pillar = Wealth** instead of "Unassigned" so the scope invariant holds for future creates.
- **Backfilled 3 existing unassigned projects** ("New Project", "another project", "OONGA BOONGA") with `moduleId: 'wealth'` via a one-time localStorage patch so they re-appear on the Work page and in the MirrorCard.
- **Spine reorder.** `NODES` order changed from `isha → tahajjud → … → maghrib` to `maghrib → tahajjud → fajr → morning → dhuhr → midday-labor → asr → isha`. Matches the traditional Islamic-day convention (sunset = start of new day), and leaves Isha as the final "rest" node.

### Files
- `src/pages/modules/Work.jsx` — seed filter extended, `PILLAR_CONTEXT='wealth'` scope filter, `handleNew` seeds pillar = wealth.
- `src/data/prophetic-path-submodules.js` — `SEEDED_PILLAR_FLAGS` extended with `_weeklyModule`, `_prayerModule`.
- `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx` — `NODES` array reordered.

### Build
✅ `npm run build` clean in 1.18s.

### Verified in preview
- `/app/work`: lists only the 3 backfilled Wealth projects; seeded weekly/prayer boards gone.
- New Project dialog: Pillar dropdown defaults to `wealth`.
- Prophetic Path spine order: Maghrib → Tahajjud → Fajr → Morning → Dhuhr → Midday Labor → Asr → Isha.

### Notes / Deferred
- The `work` module's scope is hard-coded to Wealth. If `work` ever re-appears under another pillar's `subModuleIds`, the `PILLAR_CONTEXT` constant will need to become route/context-driven (e.g. query param or per-pillar wrapper).
- 3 backfilled projects were previously `moduleId: null`; if other users/devices hold copies in their localStorage they will still need to reassign manually.

## [2026-04-23] session | Prophetic Path — pp-intro removed entirely

Decision: [[2026-04-23-prophetic-path-intro-removed]] (supersedes the Living Anchor decision, which remains on record as an intermediate solution).

### Done
- Deleted `.pp-intro__eyebrow`, `.pp-intro__bookends`, `.pp-location-cta`, and the `livingAnchor` useMemo. Trimmed `usePrayerTimes()` destructure to `{ timings }`.
- `.pp-intro` wrapper now conditional on `niyyahPillars.length > 0` — when no niyyah is carried, the Compressed Ribbon opens directly under the TopBar.
- CSS pruned accordingly; `.pp-intro` margin-bottom retained for when niyyah-echo is present.

### Files
- `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx`
- `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.css`

### Build
✅ `npm run build` clean in 1.07s.

## [2026-04-23] session | Prophetic Path — pp-intro becomes two-line Living Anchor

Decision: [[2026-04-23-prophetic-path-living-anchor]].

### Done
- **Scholar consult** (turn 9) diagnosed `.pp-intro` as "corporate AI mush" competing with the ribbon's center of gravity. Prescription: Semantic Reduction → three-line Living Anchor (eyebrow / countdown / bookends).
- **Built the three-line form** first with a live countdown driven by a 60s `setInterval` minute tick, re-using `computeNextNodeId` + `NODE_TIMING` + `NODES.find()` to resolve next-node title.
- **User trimmed the countdown** on visual review — it duplicated information the ribbon's `next` chip already carries. Final shipped form is **two lines**: city eyebrow + Fajr·Maghrib bookends. Minute tick + countdown logic removed.
- **Cleaned:** `.pp-heading`, `.pp-subheading`, `.pp-location-line` CSS rules deleted; `.pp-intro { margin-bottom }` 3rem → 4rem for Scholar's ≥64px spine gap.

### Files
- `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx` — new `livingAnchor` useMemo (Fajr/Maghrib only), JSX swap
- `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.css` — old heading rules out, new `.pp-intro__eyebrow` + `.pp-intro__bookends` in

### Build
✅ `npm run build` clean.

### Next (if desired)
- Consider applying Semantic Reduction to other ceremonial page headers (Faith overview, prayer slide-ups).

## [2026-04-23] session | FLO Redesign promoted to shared LevelOverviewPage

Decision: [[2026-04-23-flo-redesign-promotion]]. Supersedes the prototype decision.

### Done
- **JSX:** `LevelOverviewPage.jsx` now resolves pillar accent via `MAQASID_PILLARS.find(p => p.id === boardPrefix)?.accentColor`, sets `--pillar-accent` + `--level-color` inline on the `.flo` root, threads `data-progress` on cards, and passes `muted={pct === 0}` to `MasteryRing` (which now accepts the prop).
- **CSS:** `.flo::before` 2px pillar top rule + full Scholar-led phase set (editorial serif Navigator + peer titles, 60% calm-peer opacity, level halo, container-less wheel with pillar-tinted aura, bento Active Neutrality, level-tinted hover halo, 56px icon chip) appended to `LevelOverviewPage.css`. All 7 pillars inherit uniformly — zero caller changes.
- **Prototype retired:** `FloRedesignTestPage.{jsx,css}` deleted, `App.jsx` route + sidebar link removed (mirrors the 2026-04-21 wheel-promotion retirement pattern).
- **Accent source chosen:** `MAQASID_PILLARS[].accentColor`, not `MODULE_PALETTE[x].theme` — Faith's theme is `#FFFFFF` and would render an invisible top rule.

### Files
- `src/pages/shared/LevelOverviewPage.jsx` — MAQASID_PILLARS import, inline CSS vars, data-progress, muted MasteryRing
- `src/pages/shared/LevelOverviewPage.css` — `::before` rule + promoted phase block
- `src/App.jsx` — route removal
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx` — nav link removal

### Build
✅ `npm run build` clean in 1.37s.

### Next (if desired)
- Mobile viewport audit across Faith / Life / Intellect / Family / Wealth / Environment / Ummah.
- Visual pass on each pillar to confirm accentColor legibility on light + dark.

## [2026-04-23] session | FLO Redesign prototype — LevelOverviewPage at /app/flo-redesign-test

Shared `LevelOverviewPage` (all 7 pillars) redesigned behind a scoped prototype route. Decision: [[2026-04-23-flo-redesign-prototype]].

### Done
- **Prophetic Path blue smudge fix:** replaced Phase 2 `::after` ellipse aura (border-radius 50% created top-bulge on tall cards) with two-layer `box-shadow` on the card itself — inherits card radius, no ghost ellipse. Removed now-unused `overflow: visible`.
- **Scholar consult** (NotebookLM `995a59d1`, conversation `2b89f729`) → three pushbacks baked in: Calm Peers (60% opacity, not ghost-text) · Container-less Anchor (no `.flo__section` card around wheel) · Active Neutrality (ghost stroke on 0% cards, not ghost text). Scholar added: **Layered Theming** — 2px pillar top rule in `accentColor` so tier colors stay functional while pillar identity carries ambient signal.
- **Prototype scaffolding:** `FloRedesignTestPage.{jsx,css}` + route in `App.jsx` + sidebar link in `Sidebar.jsx`. All CSS scoped under `.flo-rx`. Shared production page untouched.
- **Mock progress** forces a mix of 0% and ≥1% cards (Shahada 42 / Siyam 18 / Salah·Zakah·Hajj 0) to make Active Neutrality visible.
- **Late-session trim:** user removed three `.flo-rx__section-title` H2s and one eyebrow from JSX — CSS rules retained for future reintroduction.

### Files
- `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.css` — smudge fix (box-shadow halo replaces pseudo)
- `src/pages/prototypes/FloRedesignTestPage.jsx` + `.css` — new prototype
- `src/App.jsx` — route registration
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx` — nav link

### Build
✅ `npm run build` clean.

### Next (if desired)
- Promote scoped `.flo-rx` rules onto shared `LevelOverviewPage` once user signs off on prototype.
- Thread `accentColor` so the 2px top rule works on all 7 pillars, not just Faith.

## [2026-04-23] session | Prophetic Path Phase 3 — Chip alignment + shimmer + cleanup

Final phase of the Scholar-led Prophetic Path redesign. Same decision doc extended: [[2026-04-23-prophetic-path-compressed-ribbon]] (now "Phase 1+2+3").

### Done
- **Canonical pillar accent resolver:** `resolvePillarAccent(label)` in PropheticPath.jsx — matches label against `MAQASID_PILLARS[].{id, sidebarLabel, universalLabel}` (lowercase), with `'ummah' → Community accentColor` alias. Unmapped labels ("Soul") fall back to `data-tone`.
- **Chips carry `--chip-accent` inline;** CSS targets via `[style*='--chip-accent']` attribute selector so fallbacks aren't clobbered.
- **State-driven chip intensity:** active = border 55% + bg tint 12% + 4s shimmer; next* = border 30%, muted text; past/upcoming hidden (unchanged).
- **Maqasid pulse shimmer:** `::before` gradient band translates across the chip over 4s `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1)`. `prefers-reduced-motion` opt-out sets `display: none` + `animation: none`.
- **`data-side` cleanup:** deleted `side:` from all 8 NODES entries, removed `data-side` attr from `.pp-node`, removed `mirrorSide` variable + prop threading (mirror now flows inline — no opposite-side positioning). Grep-verified zero residuals.

### Files
- `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx` — resolver, chip style binding, NODES cleanup, prop-chain trim
- `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.css` — Phase 3 chip block

### Build
✅ `npm run build` — 1.12s, zero errors. Two interim rebuilds also passed.

### Next (if desired)
- Mobile viewport audit for Phases 1+2+3
- Moontrance 8th-pillar node on the timeline (pillar exists in MAQASID_PILLARS but no NODE tags it yet)

---

## [2026-04-23] session | Prophetic Path Phase 2 — Calm prominence

Applied Scholar Q2 techniques on top of Phase 1's Compressed Ribbon. Same decision doc extended: [[2026-04-23-prophetic-path-compressed-ribbon]].

### Done
- **Editorial serif on active:** `.pp-card[data-prayer-state='active'] .pp-title` → 2.25rem / line-height 2.5rem / weight 400 / letter-spacing -0.01em. Noto Serif confirmed as `--pp-font-headline`.
- **Ghost-text receding:** past/upcoming title color `color-mix(--pp-on-surface, transparent, 45%)`; eyebrow `--pp-on-surface-variant, transparent, 30%`; hover tint killed (was 4% primary bg) — hover now only lifts opacity and restores title color.
- **Purposeful aura behind active:** new `::after` pseudo with `inset: -56px`, radial-gradient 22%→8%→0 on `--pp-primary`, `blur(60px)`, `z-index: -1`. Tahajjud (`data-style='divine'`) overrides to `--pp-tertiary` gold aura.
- **Accidental corner washes muted:** `.pp-ambient--teal` opacity halved; `.pp-ambient--gold` removed in both dark+light. The meaningful glow now lives only behind the active card.

### Files
- `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.css` — Phase 2 block added after Phase 1 state-sizing block; corner-wash opacity reduced; no JSX changes.

### Build
✅ `npm run build` — 1.37s, zero errors.

### Deferred (Phase 3)
- Maqasid pulse shimmer on active pillar chips (4s looping gradient stroke)
- Pillar chip color alignment with app's `pillar.accentColor` canonical system
- Delete dead `data-side` prop from NODES data + JSX

---

## [2026-04-23] session | Prophetic Path Phase 1 — Compressed Ribbon layout

Second UI/UX Scholar consult of the day (same NotebookLM conversation `2b89f729-…`, notebook `Modern UI/UX Design Scholar` `995a59d1-…`). Target: the Prophetic Path timeline page. Diagnosis: alternating spine + identical card sizing → no hierarchy, 3–4 scroll-heights to see the full day, CURRENT vs NEXT visually indistinguishable.

Adopted **Pattern A — Compressed Ribbon**. Decision: [[2026-04-23-prophetic-path-compressed-ribbon]].

### Done (Phase 1)
- Spine moved to far left (`left: 1.75rem`), single-column node layout — alternating left/right killed.
- Gap between nodes `8rem` → `0.75rem`; active card creates its own breathing via padding.
- State-driven card sizing via existing `data-prayer-state`:
  - `active` → full (unchanged)
  - `next`/`next-soon` → semi-expanded (title + pillars, body hidden)
  - `past`/`upcoming` → summary row (icon + eyebrow + shrunk title; body and pillars hidden; transparent bg, opacity 0.55/0.8)
- Satellites hidden on non-active nodes.
- Mirror expansion flows inline below card (dropped absolute-position opposite-side desktop rule).

### Files
- `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.css` — spine/marker/node/body rules rewritten; `[data-side]` rules deleted; new state-sizing block added; mirror floating block removed.
- JSX unchanged; `data-side` prop still emitted on `.pp-node` but no CSS reads it (deferred cleanup).

### Build
✅ `npm run build` — 2752 modules, 1.35s, zero errors. Main chunk unchanged at 542 kB gz.

### Deferred (Phase 2/3)
- Phase 2: editorial serif scale-up on Current title; container-less receding; 100px+ blurred teal/gold aura behind active; replace corner `.pp-ambient` accidents with purposeful aura.
- Phase 3: Maqasid pulse shimmer on Current pillar chips; align pillar chip colors to app's `pillar.accentColor` system instead of generic `--pp-primary/secondary/tertiary`.

---

## [2026-04-23] session | Dashboard three-tier redesign — Qalb / Amal / Barakah (Phases 4–10)

Completed the ten-phase main dashboard redesign anchored by a two-round UI/UX Scholar NotebookLM consult (conversation `2b89f729-…`). Decision: [[2026-04-23-dashboard-three-tier-redesign]].

### Done
- **Phase 4** — Zero-state information scent: BCG ghost sine-wave SVG placeholder, informative copy on empty stat cards.
- **Phase 5** — Three-tier IA wrappers: `<section className="dash-tier dash-tier--{qalb|amal|barakah}">` with bilingual Arabic/English eyebrows; `color-mix` tinted `::before` gradients per tier (accent/bg3/success).
- **Phase 6** — Kill list: removed Open Tasks panel, standalone Maqasid Focus, Activity Feed; relocated BCG Chart from Amal to Barakah; flattened `.insight-grid` two-column into single `.insight-side`; deleted dead state (`projectFilter`, `activityTab`, `openTasksAll`, `activityItems`, `pillarSummary`, `priorityColor`, `priorityOrder`, `relativeTime`).
- **Phase 7** — Daily Snapshot consolidation: 4 stat cards + Today box → 3-metric grid (Today hero / In Progress / Overdue) with vertical dividers; `STAT_CARDS` → `SNAPSHOT_METRICS` with `isHero`/`danger`/`hint` flags.
- **Phase 8** — **Daily Mithaq** widget (new): merges Manifesto + Evening Reflect into one morphing covenant widget. States: Niyyah (Sunrise icon, morning) → Muhasaba (Moon icon + Reflect CTA, after Maghrib OR deepWork ≥ 50%) → Fulfilled (CheckCircle2, reflection summary). Maghrib pivot via `usePrayerTimes()`, 6pm fallback.
- **Phase 9** — **Sakinah Meter** (reframe): replaces red `WorkflowPressure`. Three levels (settled/stirring/restless) with inverted semantics — fewer bars = less tranquil. Never uses `--danger`. Includes gentle "Ritual of Retreat" link.
- **Phase 10** — **Maqasid Balance Radar** (new): 7-axis SVG polygon normalized against max pillar; grid rings at 0.25/0.5/0.75/1.0, axis spokes, colored vertex dots, quadrant-anchored external labels, legend chips linking to `/app/pillar/{id}`. Ghost heptagon empty state. No numeric scores — shape, not score.
- **OnboardingChecklist** — already self-dismisses via 4-second celebration `useEffect`; Scholar recommendation already satisfied, no edit.

### New files
- `src/components/dashboard/DailyMithaq.{jsx,css}`
- `src/components/dashboard/MaqasidBalanceRadar.{jsx,css}`

### Build
✅ `npm run build` — 2752 modules, 1.17s, no errors. Main chunk stable at ~542 kB gz (consistent with [[2026-04-22-bundle-code-split-three-phase]] baseline).

### Orphan candidates (deferred delete)
- `src/components/dashboard/ManifestoBanner.jsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/EveningReflectButton.jsx`
  — both superseded by DailyMithaq; grep-pass before deletion.

### Notes
- `ManifestoBanner` and `EveningReflectButton` CSS classes still referenced? Needs a follow-up audit.
- Wiki: `CONTEXT.md` at `src/components/dashboard/` was rewritten mid-session to document the three-tier pattern, legacy-vs-active flags, and tier wrapper structural-not-stylistic convention.

---

## [2026-04-22] session | Bundle code-split — three phases, main chunk gzip 2,533 → 541 kB

Addressed the post-threshold bundle after [[2026-04-11-bundle-size-2mb]]'s 3 MB raw revisit trigger. Decision: [[2026-04-22-bundle-code-split-three-phase]].

### Done
- **Phase 1** (`609fecf`) — `TaskDetailPanel` now `React.lazy`-imports `SubtaskSources`, severing the transitive chain that pulled `hadith.js` (1.3 MB) + `quran-wbw.js` (536 KB) into every route. Main gz 2,533 → 2,077 kB.
- **Phase 2 + 3** (`0798946`) — `/app/sources`, `Work`, and `Project` routes converted to `lazy`; wrapped `<Routes>` in a top-level `<Suspense>` with a new `RouteSpinner`. Added `LazyMarkdown` wrapper so `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` (~80 KB gz) load only when a subtask has a description to render.
- New: `src/components/shared/RouteSpinner.jsx`, `src/components/shared/LazyMarkdown.jsx`.
- Bonus: Vite auto-extracted a 1,459 kB gz `LevelNavigator` chunk from the pillar pages when `Project` became lazy — pillar navigators now load on-demand too.

### Outcome
| Metric | Baseline | Final |
|---|---|---|
| Main chunk raw | 8,812 kB | 1,990 kB |
| Main chunk gzip | 2,533 kB | 541 kB |
| Initial JS gz (index + lib + modules + runtime) | ~2,533 kB | **~614 kB** |
| # chunks emitted | 1 | 12 |

~76% reduction in initial-load JS. Smoke-tested `/`, `/app`, `/app/work`, `/app/sources` in dev preview — all render via Suspense without console errors.

### Notes
- `vite.config.js` untouched — no `manualChunks` needed; Vite's automatic graph from dynamic `import()` produced a cleaner split than a hand-tuned vendor config would have.
- Markdown Suspense fallback renders raw description text, so subtasks are always readable even during the chunk fetch.

## [2026-04-22] hotfix | Landing.jsx Compass bare-identifier blanked the site post-consolidation

After commit 691a5cd removed `Compass` from Landing.jsx's lucide import (since the old `PILLAR_ICON_MAP` moved to `ICON_REGISTRY`), the `HOW_IT_WORKS` data array at line 324 still referenced the bare identifier `icon: Compass`. `ReferenceError: Compass is not defined` fired at module load — blanked the whole app before React could mount. Build stayed clean because Vite/Rolldown don't evaluate module-scope refs until runtime.

### Done
- Rewrote the data-array entry: `icon: Compass` → `icon: ICON_REGISTRY.Compass`. Preserves the consolidation intent (no more bare lucide identifiers in consumer files for data-layer names).

### Outcome
Preview renders again ("MAQASID / Pillars / How It Works / FAQ ..."). Commit `b2fdefd`.

### Notes
- Lesson: the "drop-on-unused-import" bug class the consolidation was meant to kill also applies to **bare-identifier references in data arrays**, not just JSX. Earlier verification greps (`<IconName`) only caught JSX usage — missed value-position references. Going forward, when removing an icon from a consumer's lucide imports, grep for the bare name *and* `<Name`.

---

## [2026-04-22] session | Icon registry consolidation — single source of truth for name→component mapping

Eliminated the drop-on-unused-import bug class that caused blank Ummah sidebar glyphs earlier in the session. Decision record: [[2026-04-22-icon-registry-consolidation]].

### Done
- New file `src/data/icon-registry.js` — single `ICON_REGISTRY` object covering every icon name referenced by `maqasid.js` (parent pillars) + `modules.js` (submodules) + legacy names. Exports `getIcon(name, fallback)` helper.
- Refactored 10 consumers to import from the registry and delete their local maps:
  - `Sidebar.jsx` — collapses `ICON_MAP` + `PILLAR_ICON_MAP` into one registry reference; import block shrank from ~50 icons to 10 (only direct-JSX chrome icons remain imported from lucide).
  - `MobileNav.jsx`, `Landing.jsx`, `Onboarding.jsx`, `TodayFocusSection.jsx`, `PillarCard.jsx`, `PillarFirstEntry.jsx` — all lost their `PILLAR_ICON_MAP`/`PILLAR_ICONS`/`ICON_MAP` blocks and pillar-icon imports.
  - `TaskDetailPanel.jsx`, `CeremonyGate.jsx`, `ModulePlaceholder.jsx` — same treatment; `TaskDetailPanel` keeps a local `LayoutGrid` extension via `{ ...ICON_REGISTRY, LayoutGrid }` because it's a fallback icon, not a data-layer name.

### Outcome
Adding a new icon name to `modules.js` now only requires editing `icon-registry.js`. All 10 consumers pick it up automatically. The two earlier-session bugs (Ummah blank glyphs, three consumers missing Family/Wealth icons) are now structurally impossible.

### Notes
- Build: 2748 → 2749 modules (new registry file), gzipped bundle 2534 → 2533 kB (tiny shrink from dedup'd import statements).
- Decision [[2026-04-22-icon-registry-consolidation]] records the full rationale.

---

## [2026-04-22] session | Cross-module icon audit — Family `home` + Ummah swap (Navigator-wins + parent Ummah `Shapes`)

Audited all 8 modules for sidebar/wheel/bento glyph drift. Six matched out of the box (Faith, Life, Intellect, Environment, Wealth, Moontrance). Two had drift:

- **Family `home`:** sidebar had `HouseHeart`, Navigator had `Home`. Fixed by updating Navigator → `HouseHeart` (sidebar-wins, matching the Wealth precedent).
- **Ummah (all 3 submodules):** sidebar had `Boxes/Home/Shapes`, Navigator had `Globe/MapPin/Users`. Per Yousef's call, **Navigator wins here** — the `Globe/MapPin/Users` set is more semantically legible for ummah/neighbors/community than the sidebar-canonical glyphs. Updated `modules.js` submodules accordingly.
- **Parent Ummah pillar icon:** changed from `Globe` to `Shapes` in `maqasid.js` (the pillar-level glyph). Propagated through all 7 `PILLAR_ICON_MAP` consumers: `Sidebar.jsx`, `MobileNav.jsx`, `Landing.jsx`, `Onboarding.jsx`, `TodayFocusSection.jsx`, `PillarCard.jsx`, `PillarFirstEntry.jsx`.

### Done
- `src/pages/family/FamilyLevelNavigator.jsx` — `Home` → `HouseHeart` for `family-home`.
- `src/data/maqasid.js` — parent Ummah `Globe` → `Shapes`.
- `src/data/modules.js` — `collective` (`Boxes`→`Globe`), `neighbors` (`Home`→`MapPin`), `community` (`Shapes`→`Users`).
- `src/pages/ummah/UmmahLevelNavigator.jsx` — reverted to `Globe/MapPin/Users` (kept consistent with new `modules.js`).
- 7 `PILLAR_ICON_MAP` consumers updated to import `Shapes` and drop `Globe` from the pillar map (Globe still imported where used for other purposes — Tech module, TaskDetailPanel).

### Outcome
Final canonical icon matrix — all 8 modules now agree across sidebar / wheel / bento:
- Faith: CheckCircle2 / HeartHandshake / HandHeart / Moon / Landmark (parent `Compass`)
- Life: Activity / BrainCircuit / Shield / Sparkles (parent `HeartPulse`)
- Intellect: Library / Lightbulb / BrainCircuit / Wrench (parent `Brain`)
- Family: Heart / Baby / Handshake / HouseHeart (parent `Users`)
- Wealth: CircleFadingArrowUp / ChessKnight / Scale / GitPullRequestCreateArrow (parent `ChessRook`)
- Environment: Droplets / Recycle / TreeDeciduous / ShoppingBag (parent `TreePine`)
- Ummah: Globe / MapPin / Users (parent `Shapes`)
- Moontrance: MapPinned / Leaf / HousePlus (parent `Moon`)

### Notes
- Decision record [[2026-04-22-wheel-two-axis-color-and-wealth-icon-canon]] established "sidebar-wins" as the default; this session records the Ummah exception where the Navigator set was chosen as more semantically legible.
- Build clean (2748 modules).

### Follow-up fix
Ummah and Neighbors submodule glyphs were missing from the sidebar after the icon-name swap in `modules.js`. Root cause: `Sidebar.jsx` keeps two separate maps — `PILLAR_ICON_MAP` for parent-pillar glyphs and `ICON_MAP` for submodule glyphs. When the parent Ummah icon was changed from `Globe` to `Shapes`, the `Globe` import was dropped because it was no longer needed by `PILLAR_ICON_MAP` — but it was simultaneously needed by `ICON_MAP` for the new `collective` submodule glyph. `MapPin` was never registered at all. Fixed by importing both `Globe` and `MapPin` and adding them to `ICON_MAP`. Lesson: when updating `modules.js` submodule icon strings, always cross-check every consumer that maintains an icon-name → component map (Sidebar, MobileNav, TaskDetailPanel, CeremonyGate, ModulePlaceholder).

### Icon-map sweep (preventative)
Expanded `ICON_MAP` coverage in the three remaining consumers to cover the full 8-module submodule canon, so any future icon-string edit in `modules.js` renders correctly without per-file follow-ups:

- **`src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.jsx`** — added `ChessKnight`, `GitPullRequestCreateArrow`, `HouseHeart`, `MapPin`, `Shapes`, `MapPinned`, `Leaf`, `HousePlus`, `PencilRuler`, `SquareTerminal`.
- **`src/components/islamic/CeremonyGate.jsx`** — added `PencilRuler`, `SquareTerminal`, `TrendingUp`, `Star`, `CheckCircle2`, `HeartHandshake`, `HouseHeart`, `HandHeart`, `Landmark`, `ChessKnight`, `GitPullRequestCreateArrow`, `Globe`, `MapPin`, `Shapes`, `MapPinned`, `Leaf`, `HousePlus`.
- **`src/pages/ModulePlaceholder.jsx`** — added `Heart`, `HouseHeart`, `Home`, `Building2`, `ChessKnight`, `GitPullRequestCreateArrow`, `Droplets`, `Recycle`, `Shield`, `TrendingUp`, `Star`, `CheckCircle2`, `Moon`, `Landmark`, `Globe`, `MapPin`, `Users`, `Shapes`, `MapPinned`, `HousePlus`, `PencilRuler`, `SquareTerminal`.

Legacy glyphs (`Wallet`, `PiggyBank`, `Kanban`, `Store`, `Share2`, etc.) retained for backward compat with any stored project data still referencing them.

---

## [2026-04-22] session | Wheel two-axis color model + Wealth icon canon

Decoupled the Maqasid Comparison Wheel's module-identity ring from the level-progress fill, inverted the `.mcw-seg-bg` hover dimming, and canonicalized Wealth submodule icons across sidebar, wheel, and bento. Decision record: [[2026-04-22-wheel-two-axis-color-and-wealth-icon-canon]].

### Done
- **Two-axis color model** — `src/data/module-palette.js` rewritten: universal `LEVEL_COLORS` (gold/green/purple) + per-module `theme` hex. `MaqasidComparisonWheel` gained a `themeColor` prop (falls back to `levelColor`); band gradient now uses `themePalette.base` so each module keeps its identity ring across all three levels. All 8 `<Module>LevelOverview.jsx` files pass `themeColor: MODULE_PALETTE.<module>.theme` via `wheelExtraProps`. Faith theme currently white (`#FFFFFF`) per Yousef's call.
- **`.mcw-seg-bg` inversion** — base `fill-opacity` 0.55 → 0.25 (lighter at rest); new `:has(.is-hovered)` rule raises non-hovered peers to 0.9 (darker on neighbour hover). Removed `.mcw-seg-bg` from the shared peer-dim rule to prevent opacity collision.
- **Wealth icon canon** — swapped Earning and Circulation glyphs per final directive. Canon is now: Earning=`CircleFadingArrowUp`, Financial=`ChessKnight`, Ownership=`Scale`, Circulation=`GitPullRequestCreateArrow`. Propagated to `src/data/modules.js` (sidebar `ICON_MAP` reads from here), `src/pages/wealth/WealthLevelNavigator.jsx` (`WEALTH_PILLARS` feeds wheel + bento), and legacy `src/pages/wealth/WealthDashboard.jsx`.
- **Dev-only 50% progress simulation** — `VITE_SIMULATE_PROGRESS` env var read once in `src/hooks/useModuleProgress.js`; short-circuits both hooks to return `{ total: 10, completed, started: 10, pct }` per pillar when set. `.env.local` gitignored. No Zustand pollution.

### Deferred
- Audit other modules (Faith / Life / Intellect / Family / Environment / Ummah / Moontrance) for submodule-icon divergence — only Wealth was flagged this session.
- `project-store.js` `wealth_circulation_*` boards still use `CircleFadingArrowUp` (board-identity icon, not submodule icon). Intentional, but worth re-evaluating if board icons should track submodule canon.

### Notes
- Build clean (2748 modules) at each step.
- Sidebar `ICON_MAP` already imported both glyphs — swap was a pure string rename in `modules.js`, no import changes.
- Project-board icons live in a separate axis (`moduleId`-keyed) and were left untouched by design.

---

## [2026-04-22] session | Time-based Islamic Layer on the timeline route

Made `IslamicPanel` route-aware so `/app/prophetic-path-test` swaps the module-centric body for prayer-phase content. Decision record: [[2026-04-22-timeline-islamic-layer-route]].

### Done
- New helper `inferPhaseForNode(nodeId, now, timings)` + `NODE_TIMING_KEY` map in [src/data/prophetic-path-submodules.js](src/data/prophetic-path-submodules.js) (25-min before / 15-min during windows around each node anchor).
- New seed [src/data/islamic/time-based-content.js](src/data/islamic/time-based-content.js) — keyed by node × phase, reuses `AYAH_BANNER_DATA.faith_salah` (Quran 29:45) for the prayer "during" slot and `ONGOING_DUA` (Quran 9:129) for ongoing dhikr; `before`/`after` render English-only intent text per [[amanah-gate]].
- New component [src/components/islamic/TimelineIslamicContent.jsx](src/components/islamic/TimelineIslamicContent.jsx) + companion CSS — renders window header (node + Arabic + phase + countdown), ayah card, dhikr card, intent block, and tasks-for-window list with deep links to `#node-{id}`. Minute-tick `setInterval` keeps node/phase live.
- [src/components/islamic/IslamicPanel.jsx](src/components/islamic/IslamicPanel.jsx) now imports `useLocation`, branches `.il-content` on `pathname.startsWith('/app/prophetic-path-test')`, hides the Pillar Context + Module badges on the timeline route, and switches `ceremonyKey` to `'timeline'` so Begin/Close ceremony state stays scoped.
- Verified in dev preview at `/app/prophetic-path-test`: header reads "Tahajjud · تهجد · AFTER · LINGERING", "Next: Dhuhr 13:17 · in 7h 51m"; tasks count badge populated; non-regression on `/app/faith` (existing Opening Dua intact); Universal mode on timeline gracefully falls back to "No content for this module" by design.

### Deferred
- Editorial backlog: fill `before`/`after` slots and node-specific hadith from vetted Muslim Scholar NotebookLM corpora (Bukhari, Muslim, Quran) so non-prayer windows surface authentic Arabic instead of intent text.
- `/app/faith` Module Badge absence is pre-existing (Faith pillar isn't in `MODULES`); unrelated to this change but worth flagging in a future polish pass.

### Notes
- Build: 2748 modules clean, no console errors.
- Pre-existing 670 lint errors unchanged (vendor + project-wide). My new files contributed zero net errors after dropping a `useMemo` that the React Compiler flagged.
- Pattern is reusable: any future route-anchored sidebar surface can branch on `useLocation` the same way.

## [2026-04-22] session | Unified module dashboard template — Faith shape applied to all 8 modules

Rolled Faith's route-driven dashboard template across every remaining Maqasid module. Decision record: [wiki/decisions/2026-04-22-unified-module-dashboard-template.md](wiki/decisions/2026-04-22-unified-module-dashboard-template.md).

### Done
- **Life / Intellect / Family / Wealth / Environment** — each module now has `{Module}LevelNavigator.jsx` (constants + compact nav), `{Module}LevelOverview.jsx` (thin wrapper over `LevelOverviewPage` with wheel + bento + PathToExcellence slots), and `{Module}PathToExcellenceCards.jsx`. The three per-level pages (`*CorePage.jsx` / `*GrowthPage.jsx` / `*ExcellencePage.jsx`) reduced to one-line `<...LevelOverview level="…" levelColor={MODULE_PALETTE.X.Y} />` renders. `*CorePage.jsx` re-exports the `<MODULE>_*` constants so submodule pages and `submodule-registry.js` keep resolving named imports.
- **Ummah / Moontrance** — same template applied; their legacy sections (Frameworks for both; Milestones + OLOS Bridge for Moontrance) moved below the unified template into a `.ummah-dash--appendix` container. `<MODULE>_LEVEL_ROUTES` all map to the single dashboard path for now so LevelNavigator pills render but are visual-only — additive upgrade path once level boards exist.
- **Cross-fade on navigation** — removed `key={location.key}` from `<main>` in [AppShell.jsx](src/components/layout/AppShell.jsx) (was force-remounting the entire subtree). All level-switch and pillar-drill `navigate()` calls in [LevelOverviewPage.jsx](src/pages/shared/LevelOverviewPage.jsx) and [MaqasidComparisonWheel.jsx](src/components/faith/MaqasidComparisonWheel.jsx) now pass `{ viewTransition: true }`. CSS in [LevelOverviewPage.css](src/pages/shared/LevelOverviewPage.css) drives a 260ms opacity crossfade via `::view-transition-old/new(root)` with `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback.
- **Single sources of truth** — `MODULE_PALETTE` gained `moontrance`; `PILLAR_WISDOM` + `PILLAR_NEXT_ACTIONS` gained stub entries for Life/Intellect/Family/Wealth/Environment/Ummah/Moontrance.
- `MaqasidComparisonWheel` generalized: `pillarWisdom` and `nextActions` are now null-safe props supplied by each module's overview wrapper.

### Deferred
- Delete `src/components/shared/ModuleWheelSection.jsx` — no remaining consumers, safe removal next session.
- Per-module content sprint for real pillar wisdom (ayat) and next-action strings — stubs ship as "Reflection coming soon".
- Ummah / Moontrance real per-level core/growth/excellence boards — seed tasks already prefixed (`ummah_moontrance-land_core` etc.) for an additive build-out.

### Notes
- Build: 2728 modules clean, no lint regressions.
- Yousef's directive guided the rollout: *"every single module main page uniform."*

## [2026-04-22] session | fmt() secondary surfaces + Tashahhud side view + PrayerOverlay de-lock

Follow-up pass on the same day as the diacritical-toggle ship.

### 1. fmt() applied to secondary Arabic surfaces
Wired the `useArabic` hook into 9 more render sites so the global tashkīl toggle now reaches data-driven Arabic beyond the primary prayer surfaces:
- [HadithCard.jsx](src/components/islamic/HadithCard.jsx) — `data.ar`
- [QuranVerseCard.jsx](src/components/islamic/QuranVerseCard.jsx) — `word.ar` (word-by-word)
- [WheelWisdomTooltip.jsx](src/components/faith/WheelWisdomTooltip.jsx) — `wisdom.arabic`
- [TopBar.jsx](src/components/layout/TopBar.jsx) — `ayahBannerData.arabic`
- [EveningReflectModal.jsx](src/components/dashboard/EveningReflectModal.jsx) — `f.arabic`
- [OverviewCards.jsx](src/components/shared/OverviewCards.jsx) — `item.arabic` + `item.ayahArabic`
- [IslamicTerm.jsx](src/components/shared/IslamicTerm.jsx) — glossary tooltip `entry.arabic`
- [SubtaskSources.jsx](src/components/work/SubtaskSources.jsx) — grounding fallbacks (both hadith + non-Quran branches)
- [ReadinessCheck.jsx](src/components/islamic/ReadinessCheck.jsx) — `current._attr.ar` header

Skipped: the markdown-children branch of `SubtaskSources.jsx` (line 52) — children-tree transformation is invasive and the two direct entry renders cover the common path.

### 2. Tashahhud posture — side view
Redrew [Tashahhud.jsx](src/components/islamic/postures/Tashahhud.jsx) from a front-facing SVG to a profile view facing right: torso upright, right thigh horizontal forward, shin folded back under, left foot tucked beneath the seat (iftirash), visible arm draped with the index finger extending forward past the knee. Same viewBox + stroke style so it reads cohesively with the other posture icons.

### 3. PrayerOverlay — removed app-wide lockout; Bismillah button
- **De-locked:** fullscreen `position: fixed; inset: 0` with 88% black backdrop + focus trap + `aria-modal="true"` → bottom-right card with `pointer-events: none` on the wrapper (only `.prayer-content` is interactive). Rest of the app remains visible and operable while prayer overlay is showing. `role="dialog"` → `role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`. `useFocusTrap` import removed.
- **Button:** "Return to work" → `الحمد لله · Alhamdu'lil'llah` (Arabic + English side-by-side, gap-2). Arabic routed through `fmt()` so it honors the diacritical toggle; new `.prayer-dismiss-ar` / `.prayer-dismiss-en` selectors. (Initially "Bismillah" — revised to Alhamdulillah since the dismiss action closes a completed prayer window, not opens one.)
- **Card sizing:** scaled down type scale (5xl/6xl → 2xl) to match corner-card footprint instead of viewport-center scale.

---

## [2026-04-22] session | Arabic diacritical toggle + UI/UX Scholar consult

Shipped the two deferred items from the Isha/Fajr "During" pilot.

### 1. Arabic diacritical (tashkīl) toggle — global
- **New util:** [src/utils/arabic.js](src/utils/arabic.js) — `stripDiacritics(s)` removes U+064B–U+0652 + U+0670. Deliberately preserves U+0671 (Alef Wasla, a letter form) and U+06D6–U+06ED (Qur'anic recitation marks).
- **Store:** `showDiacritics` + `setShowDiacritics` in [src/store/settings-store.js](src/store/settings-store.js), default ON, persisted under `show_diacritics` localStorage key.
- **Hook:** [src/hooks/useArabic.js](src/hooks/useArabic.js) returns `fmt(arabic)` formatter; source data is never mutated.
- **Wired at render sites:** `PrayerHeroDuring.jsx` (Reference + Pray-Along + RecitationPanel), `DuaSection.jsx` (shared across NiyyahAct, IslamicPanel, elsewhere), `NiyyahAct.jsx` (inline bismillah), `PrayerOverlay.jsx` (inline bismillah), `ThresholdModal.jsx` (4 pause/istirja ayah render sites).
- **UI:** New button in [IslamicPanel.jsx](src/components/islamic/IslamicPanel.jsx) header next to Islamic/Universal toggle and Cite button. Gated on Islamic mode. Glyph: `ً` (tanwin fathatan — self-encoding). CSS: `.il-diacritics-btn` mirrors `.il-citations-btn`.
- **Out of scope (deferred):** readiness ayat, hadith, seed tasks, module overviews — follow-up pass once primary surfaces validate.

### 2. UI/UX Scholar NotebookLM consult
- `notebooklm-py` installed; invocation via `python -m notebooklm` (no CLI shim on PATH — known, working).
- Consulted notebook `995a59d1` (Modern UI/UX Design Scholar) on the three post-V1 flags: diacritical toggle UX, corner mode-toggle discoverability, halo-vs-austere-bg tradeoffs.
- Synthesis + implementation gaps recorded in [wiki/decisions/2026-04-22-prayerhero-uiux-consult.md](wiki/decisions/2026-04-22-prayerhero-uiux-consult.md).
- Guardrail honored: UI/UX notebook is informational, not cross-referenced with Muslim Scholar; no fiqh-adjacent claims sourced from it.

## [2026-04-22] session | PropheticPath time-window "Current" + TaskDetailPanel slide-up

Two unrelated UX fixes.

### 1. PropheticPath: time-window active detection + 10-min next-soon unfade
- **Symptom:** At 3:23 AM, Tahajjud (3:00 AM · Last Third) rendered faded with no badge while Fajr (4:58 AM) got the "NEXT" badge. Expected Tahajjud to read "Current".
- **Root cause:** `deriveNodeTiming` only set `'active'` when the node matched the Aladhan hook's `activePrayer` — which only tracks the five canonical salawat. Tahajjud / Morning / Midday-Labor could never reach `'active'` and fell through to `'upcoming'`.
- **Fix:** New helper `computeActiveNodeId(timings)` ([PropheticPath.jsx](src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx)) — finds the node whose anchor is the most-recent past anchor (`now - anchor` smallest non-negative, with 24h wrap). Applies to all 8 nodes. `deriveNodeTiming` now checks `nodeId === activeNodeId` instead of the canonical-prayer guard; `CANONICAL_PRAYER_NODES` and the `activePrayer` dep are gone.
- **10-minute lead:** When the next node's anchor is ≤10min away, state is promoted from `'next'` to `'next-soon'` — new CSS rule `[data-prayer-state='next-soon']` sets opacity to 1 (full unfade) while keeping the "Next" badge. Chip selector extended to match both.
- **Badge text:** "Now" → "Current" per user wording.
- **Verification:** `preview_eval` with `Date` stubbed: at 3:01 AM Tahajjud=`active`, Fajr=`next`; at 4:50 AM (8 min before Fajr) Fajr=`next-soon` opacity 1; at 4:47 AM (11 min before) Fajr=`next` opacity 0.78.

### 2. TaskDetailPanel: slide-up instead of scale-fade popup
- Replaced `tdpScaleIn/Out` (scale 0.4→1 with dynamic `transformOrigin` from clicked card rect) with `tdpSlideIn/Out` (translateY 100%→0) in [TaskDetailPanel.css](src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.css).
- Overlay `align-items: center` → `flex-end` so the panel docks at the bottom of the viewport.
- Panel border-radius changed from uniform 24px to `24px 24px 0 0` (bottom-sheet shape); `max-height` 85vh → 90vh.
- Removed now-dead `computeTransformOrigin`, `transformOrigin` state, and its `useLayoutEffect` from [TaskDetailPanel.jsx](src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.jsx).
- **Blast radius:** four callers inherit automatically — ProjectBoard, PrayerLevelPage, PillarLevelPage, PropheticPath.
- **Verification:** synthesized panel in preview confirms `animationName: tdpSlideIn`, `overlayAlign: flex-end`, `borderRadius: 24px 24px 0px 0px`. Live task-click not reachable in current seed (only BBOS empty-cell cards available on the one seeded project).

**Decisions:** none filed.

**Deferred:** Visual confirmation of live slide-up interaction once a seed project with real kanban tasks is available.

**Files changed:** `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx`, `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.css`, `src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.jsx`, `src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.css`.

## [2026-04-22] session | BBOS dashboard layout normalization

Three small, reviewer-visible fixes to BBOS ProjectBoard / Dashboard surfaces.

### 1. Subsegment visibility in dark mode
- `.fln__subseg` for todo-state tasks was returning `var(--bg3)` (#22262e) — same tone as the surrounding card surface in dark mode, making progress bars read as a blank strip. Changed fallback color to `var(--border2)` (#353b45) in both the default `taskColor` helper ([LevelNavigator.jsx:46](src/components/shared/LevelNavigator.jsx:46)) and the BBOS override `bbosTaskColorFn` ([ProjectBoard.jsx:169](src/components/work/ProjectBoard.jsx:169)). Light mode (#ced3d9) still reads fine.

### 2. Strategic Tasks width + position consistent across all BBOS stages
- **Symptom:** `.bfd` (Strategic Tasks outer container) rendered at different widths across stages — e.g. FND=799px vs OFR=745px (54px spread, ~27px rightward shift of cards).
- **Root cause:** `.bfd` is a `display:block` child of a flex-column parent with `max-width:1200px; margin:0 auto;` but no explicit `width`. Flex-column block children with `flex: 0 1 auto` shrink to their intrinsic min-content. Stages where `hasBoth === true` ([BbosFullDashboard.jsx:1809](src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx:1809)) nest the factory inside `.bfd__factory-content > .bfd__factory-content__layer`, and that nested grid reports a smaller min-content than FND's flat factory — shrinking `.bfd` and centering it via auto margins.
- **Fix:** `.bfd { width: 100% }` ([BbosFullDashboard.css:6](src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css:6)) — stretches to parent up to the 1200px cap.
- Complementary: `scrollbar-gutter: stable` on the ProjectBoard dashboard scroll container ([ProjectBoard.jsx:446](src/components/work/ProjectBoard.jsx:446)) prevents vertical-scrollbar shift from re-introducing ~6px drift.
- **Result:** factory width = 470px / cardX = 37 across all 8 BBOS stages (FND/TRU/STR/OFR + OUT/SAL/DLR/RET). Spread = 0px (target was ≤1px).

### 3. Stage description centered
- `.bfd__desc` got `text-align: center` + `margin: auto` ([BbosFullDashboard.css:28-36](src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css:28)). The 640px max-width now centers inside the stage header with the title above.

**Decisions:** none filed (cosmetic bug fixes).

**Verification:** `preview_eval` measurement harness confirms identical width across all 8 stages. Visual screenshot at OFR/SAL matches FND/IDENTITY layout.

**Deferred:** none.

**Files changed:** `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css`, `src/components/shared/LevelNavigator.jsx`, `src/components/work/ProjectBoard.jsx`, `src/components/work/DashboardView.css`.

## [2026-04-22] session | Wheel becomes nav surface; iOS Safari icon fix; Mithaq paused

**Context:** Round 5 (earlier today) shipped Mithaq + Nur Aura. Live iPhone testing + hover-contrast review surfaced four follow-ups.

**Completed:**
- **Mithaq paused** on Faith overview (`mithaqDomain` prop removed); store/hook/dormant-state infrastructure retained for future re-enable.
- **Hover contrast inversion** — aura opacity 0.75→0.5; icon flips to dark `#0c1a20` on hover (Lucide `currentColor`) instead of carrying a bright drop-shadow. Eliminates the Chrome `foreignObject` bounding-box square.
- **Wheel becomes nav surface** — outer band + inner sector now carry click + Enter/Space handlers, `role="button"`, `tabIndex`, `useNavigate(seg.route)`. `LevelOverviewPage` passes `p.route` through to segments.
- **Cursor-handoff crossfade** — 90ms leave-debounce keeps hover continuous across sectors; transitions moved from inside `:has()` blocks to base selectors so opacity tweens both in AND out of the dim set. Duration bumped 240→360ms.
- **iOS Safari icon positioning fixed** — replaced `<foreignObject><div><Icon/></div></foreignObject>` with nested SVG: `<g transform="translate(ix-9 iy-9)"><g class="mcw-icon-wrap"><Icon/></g></g>`. WebKit's foreignObject mispositioning with CSS custom properties + fractional x/y is sidestepped entirely.
- ADR: [[2026-04-22-wheel-clickable-submodules-ios-fix]]

**Deferred:**
- Mithaq re-enablement pending ritual-UX re-validation (Round 6 candidate).
- Touch-device hover/tap pattern still mouse-oriented.

**Notes:**
- CSS lesson worth remembering: a `transition` declared inside a conditional `:has()` / `:not()` rule only fires while that rule matches — one-way animation. For bidirectional tweens, transitions MUST live on the base selector.
- iOS Safari `<foreignObject>` quirk reproduces when the parent `<g>` has CSS custom properties AND x/y are floats. Nested SVG is the cleanest workaround and unlocks future filter/animation portability.

## [2026-04-22] session | Prophetic Path — live prayer times + spotlight focus mode

Four-phase session on `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.{jsx,css}`.

### Phase 1 — Live prayer times wired to timeline
- Consumed `usePrayerTimes()` inside `PropheticPath`; passed per-node `timing` (time / anchor-label / state) down to `TimelineNode`. 5 canonical prayer nodes render 12-hour chips; transition nodes use Aladhan extended keys (`morning` → `Sunrise`, `tahajjud` → `Lastthird`, `midday-labor` anchors on Dhuhr with "After Dhuhr" label).
- `Now` / `Next` badges keyed off `activePrayer.name` + computed `nextNodeId`. `data-prayer-state` on `.pp-node` / `.pp-card` / `.pp-marker` drives all downstream styling.
- Empty state: "Set location for live prayer times" CTA calls `requestLocation()`; populated shows "Prayer times for {cityName}".

### Phase 2 — Spotlight / focused-dimming (P0 + P1)
- Consulted UI/UX Design scholar notebook (`995a59d1`) for the illuminated-active / dim-others pattern. Implemented per scholar guidance:
  - Past: `opacity 0.42`, `saturate(0.55)` · Upcoming: `opacity 0.42`, `saturate(0.7)` · Next: `opacity 0.78` · Active: `opacity 1`, no filter.
  - 400ms cubic-bezier transitions on opacity + filter.
  - Active card ring + soft elevation via `color-mix(in srgb, var(--pp-primary) …)`.
  - Nur halo on active marker: `radial-gradient` + `pp-nur-breathe` 6s ease-in-out.
  - Next badge pulse stretched to 4s (avoids fatigue).

### Phase 3 — P2 polish (no glassmorph)
- Staggered mount `pp-node-rise` — transform-only (12px → 0) with `nth-child(1..9)` delays 0–400ms so dim states retain opacity authority.
- Active-node typography: chip weight 700 + letter-spacing -0.01em; title weight 600.
- Dimmed-text legibility: past/upcoming eyebrow + body promoted to `--pp-on-surface` so content remains readable beneath the dim veil (WCAG-safe).
- `prefers-reduced-motion` guard disables rise, pulse, breathe.

### Phase 4 — Wrap-around-aware next-node computation
- **Bug** (user screenshot at 02:35 local): Fajr (04:58) was labelled NEXT instead of Tahajjud (03:00). Root cause: `usePrayerTimes.getNextPrayer()` only iterates the 5 canonical prayers — Tahajjud / Morning / Midday-Labor are invisible.
- **Fix**: `computeNextNodeId(timings)` walks all 8 `NODE_TIMING` entries with 24h wrap for already-passed anchors; picks smallest positive diff. `deriveNodeTiming` now takes `nextNodeId` directly.
- **Related bug** (caught during Phase 2): midday-labor stole 'active' from Dhuhr because both share the `Dhuhr` timing key. Guard via `CANONICAL_PRAYER_NODES` set — only canonical prayer nodes can enter 'active'.

**Decisions:** none filed (within existing design language + scholar-validated tokens).

**Verification:** `npm run build` clean across all phases. Preview confirmed: 8 chips render, NEXT/Now badges correct, spotlight gradient visible past→next→active, staggered mount smooth, Tahajjud correctly marked NEXT at 02:37 test case.

**Deferred:** Chip wrap on ultra-narrow cards; live-times strip on Dashboard sanctuary widget.

**Files changed:** `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx`, `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.css`.

## [2026-04-21] session | Prayer slide-up subtasks — two-axis grounding migration

**Completed:**
- Pilot rollout of the structured `GroundingSource[]` schema ([[2026-04-18-milos-grounding-two-axis]]) to the 18 prayer-slide-up boards. All 87 subtasks across `prayer_{fajr|dhuhr|asr|maghrib|isha|tahajjud}_{before|during|after}` now carry `why` / `how` / `sources[]` with per-source `provenanceTier` (Bayyinah/Qarina/Niyyah) and `relevance` (direct/contextual/thematic). Verified: `total: 87, grounded: 87, legacy: 0`.
- Extended `PRAYER_GUIDE` structure in `src/data/seed-tasks/prayer-seed-tasks.js` for Dhuhr/Asr/Maghrib/Isha/Tahajjud — 9 new grounded structure rows anchored on Sahih Muslim 728a (twelve muʾakkadah rawātib), Bukhari 759 (silent Dhuhr), Tirmidhi 430 (four before Asr), Bukhari 765 (Tur at Maghrib), Ibn Majah 1166 (Kafirun+Ikhlas after Maghrib), Bukhari 657 (heaviest-on-hypocrites Isha), Muslim 752 & Abu Dawud 1422 (Witr), Bukhari 990 & Muslim 767b (Qiyām two-by-two), Bukhari 1147 (Aishah's eleven-rakʿat ceiling).
- Migrated 7 parent tasks / 20 distinct subtasks in `faith-seed-tasks.js` from free-form Markdown `sources` strings to structured arrays (tasks 2850, 2882, 2930, 2946, 2986, 3397, 3728). Arabic + translation populated directly on every entry so cards bypass the fawazahmed0 bundle.
- T3 display label renamed "Aspiration" → "Niyyah" in `amanah-tiers.js` to match canonical [[amanah-gate-protocol]].
- Added `RelevanceChip` component + `relevance-chips.js` config. `TaskDetailPanel` + `SubtaskSources` branch on `Array.isArray(sources)` with legacy Markdown fallback preserved for unrelated pillars.
- Documented the `hadith-overrides.js` standard procedure (shallow-merge over auto-generated `hadith.js`) and the transliteration+translation parentheses rule.

**Decisions:** [[2026-04-21-prayer-subtask-grounding]]

**Verification:** `npm run build` clean (1.68s, 2703 modules). `node -e import('./src/data/seed-tasks/prayer-seed-tasks.js')` confirms 18 boards / 87 grounded / 0 legacy. `npm run lint` — 625 pre-existing unrelated errors, none introduced this session.

**Deferred:** Live-preview screenshot sweep of all 18 boards; structured-source migration for the remaining pillars (Faith non-prayer, Life, Intellect, Family, Wealth, Environment, Ummah — ~1,849 legacy strings remain codebase-wide).

**Files changed:** `src/data/seed-tasks/{prayer-seed-tasks,faith-seed-tasks}.js`, `src/data/config/{amanah-tiers,relevance-chips}.js`, `src/components/shared/RelevanceChip.jsx`, `src/components/work/{TaskDetailPanel,SubtaskSources}.jsx`, `src/data/hadith-overrides.js`; new: `wiki/decisions/2026-04-21-prayer-subtask-grounding.md`.

## [2026-04-21] session | Faith dashboard wheel promotion + level-color theming

**Completed:**
- Promoted `MaqasidComparisonWheel` + `PathToExcellenceCards` from the `/app/dashboard-wheel-test` prototype route onto the real Faith overview page (all three levels) via opt-in props on the shared `LevelOverviewPage`: `showComparisonWheel`, `ComparisonWheelComponent`, `wheelCenterLabel`, `ExcellenceCardsComponent`.
- Wheel now binds to live task-store progress via the existing `useModulesProgress` hook — identical source to the bento `MasteryRing`, so the two are in sync by construction (no new selector).
- Level-color theming: added `levelColor` prop on the wheel. Progress radial gradient stops and outer label-band linear gradient now derive from `levelColor` via opacity falloff; segment stroke wired via `--mcw-level-color` CSS custom property. Removed per-segment `color` field (wheel now expresses one level's palette, not five pillar identities). Verified recolor at core `#C8A96E` (gold) / growth `#4ab8a8` (teal) / excellence `#8b5cf6` (purple) via `preview_eval`.
- Moved both components out of `src/pages/prototypes/components/` into `src/components/faith/`. Deleted the prototype page, route (`src/App.jsx`), and sidebar nav entry. `FlaskConical` import preserved in Sidebar for the remaining Prophetic Path prototype.

**Decisions:** [[2026-04-21-faith-dashboard-wheel-promotion]] (supersedes [[2026-04-20-dashboard-wheel-test-prototype]])

**Verification:** Preview screenshots at `/app/faith-core` (gold) and `/app/faith-excellence` (purple) captured. `/app/life-core` regression-checked — no wheel, no excellence cards. `npm run build` clean (2691 modules). No new lint errors.

**Deferred:** Real data binding for Path to Excellence CTAs; extending wheel to other pillars; promoting wheel layout onto the main `/app` Sanctuary dashboard.

**Files changed:** `src/pages/shared/LevelOverviewPage.{jsx,css}`, `src/pages/faith/FaithLevelOverview.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`; moves: `src/pages/prototypes/components/{MaqasidComparisonWheel,PathToExcellenceCards}.{jsx,css}` → `src/components/faith/`; deletes: `src/pages/prototypes/DashboardWheelTestPage.{jsx,css}`.

## [2026-04-21] session | graphify --update full Maqasid/Milos run + bridge trace

**Completed:**
- Ran `/graphify --update` on the full Maqasid/Milos corpus. Scope: everything except `atlas/` submodule (859 files) and `graphify-out/` outputs (923 files) → 191 actionable files from 1,973 detected changes.
- AST extraction on 74 code files → 334 nodes / 824 edges.
- 7 parallel semantic subagents on 117 uncached files (5 doc chunks of 23 + 2 image singletons) → 134 nodes / 108 edges / 15 hyperedges.
- Merged into existing graph via `G_existing.update(G_new)` → **1,535 nodes, 1,532 edges, 286 communities**.
- Hand-labeled top 27 communities (e.g. c0 "People & HR Module", c1 "App Modules & Shell", c3 "BBOS Task & Work Boards", c10 "BBOS Dashboard Views", c13 "Islamic Attribute Rendering", c14 "Hadith Enrichment Pipeline").
- Regenerated `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`, `graph.html`, `graph.json`, `manifest.json`, `cost.json`. Benchmark: 3,985× token reduction vs full-corpus reads.
- **Bridge trace** of top-betweenness node `src_data_bbos_bbos_task_definitions_js` (score 0.031). Three successive queries (`.graphify_query{,2,3}.py`) revealed a structural contradiction: node had only 3 `contains` edges to its own exported functions, zero inbound edges, 4-node 3-hop neighborhood. Filesystem grep found 9 real consumers importing from it.
- **Targeted re-extraction**: single subagent on the 9 consumer files (`BbosFullDashboard.jsx`, `ProjectBoard.jsx`, `BbosTaskPanel.jsx`, `Dashboard.jsx`, `project-store.js`, `JournalPanel.jsx`, `ScopeGate.jsx`, `context-gatherer.js`, + the data file) emitted `.graphify_bridge_patch.json` with 12 nodes, 21 edges (8 imports + 8 calls + 5 shares_data_with), 1 hyperedge. Merged via `.graphify_merge_patch.py` → edges total 1,553. Bridge dissolved; target's betweenness dropped 0.031 → 0.0027; all 11 neighbors collapsed into community 1.

**Decisions:**
- **graphify extraction gap on `src/data/**` consumers is real and accepted as a known limitation** — see [[2026-04-21-graphify-extraction-gaps]]. High-betweenness + low-degree is now treated as an audit signal (likely extraction artifact), not a finding. Targeted patches are the remedy; bulk `--mode deep` re-run on `src/data/**` consumers deferred to next full graphify pass.

**Verified:**
- Final graph state confirmed via direct NetworkX queries: `bbos-task-definitions.js` degree = 11, betweenness = 0.0027, all neighbors in community 1.
- Report regen after patch hit a `detection_result['total_files']` schema mismatch (cosmetic); `graph.json` persisted cleanly.

**Deferred:**
- Full `--mode deep` re-run on `src/data/**` to surface latent consumer→data edges across `readiness-ayahs.js`, `bbos-stages.js`, `islamic-data.js`, seed-tasks files.
- Bulk re-cluster of `graph.json` with the patched edges (community 3 + community 10 labels now stale).
- Upstream issue to `graphifyy` re: data-file import resolution in AST layer.

**Files changed:** `graphify-out/graph.json`, `graphify-out/graph.html`, `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`, `graphify-out/manifest.json`, `graphify-out/cost.json`, `graphify-out/cache/*` (117 new), `wiki/entities/graphify.md`, `wiki/decisions/2026-04-21-graphify-extraction-gaps.md` (new), `wiki/log.md`, `wiki/index.md`, `.gitignore` (added `.graphify_*.py`).

## [2026-04-21] session | Threshold-trigger Before/After + interactive closing reflection

**Completed:**
- **`src/data/seed-tasks/weekly-seed-tasks.js`** (new) — `WEEKLY_SEED_TASKS` + `WEEKLY_BOARDS` for three new boards (`weekly_work` 4 tasks, `weekly_wealth` 5 tasks, `weekly_community` 4 tasks). Each item is a weekly-cadence planning task (mission-statement review, shutdown review, revenue review, silat al-rahim check-in, etc.) tagged `cadence:weekly`.
- **`src/store/project-store.js`** — imported weekly seeds + boards; added `ensureWeeklyProjects()` action mirroring `ensurePrayerProjects` (idempotent seed + project creation, `_weeklyModule: true` flag); included `WEEKLY_SEED_TASKS` in `backfillAndStripSeeds`' `ALL_SEEDS`.
- **`src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx`** — imported `useThresholdStore`; added `THRESHOLD_TRIGGER_NODES = new Set(['midday-labor','morning'])` + `DEFAULT_THRESHOLD_MODULE_BY_NODE = { morning: 'work' }`. In `TimelineNode`, Before satellite → `setOpeningModuleId(thresholdModuleId)`, After → `setClosingModuleId(thresholdModuleId)` for the two scoped nodes. Module id resolves from the active pill (wealth/community for midday-labor) or falls back to `work`. Non-threshold nodes retain MirrorCard expansion. Added `ensureWeeklyProjects()` effect on mount.
- **`src/components/islamic/ReadinessCheck.jsx`** — `RCInteractive` now auto-advances with a 320 ms crossfade after a card selection (ref-backed timeout, cleared on unmount; deselect/final-row do not advance). Removed the inner Next button (auto-advance handles forward motion); Previous renamed to **Back** and only renders from row 2 onward. New `frame` prop rendered above the card content (closes a pre-existing gap where `community` / `moontrance-*` reflection frames were silently dropped). Top-level `ReadinessCheck` forwards `readiness.frame` through the interactive branch.
- **`src/components/islamic/ReadinessCheck.css`** — new `.rc-card-content--fade` modifier + `@keyframes rcCrossfadeIn` (opacity 0→1, 4px lift) for auto-advance transition; new `.rc-card-wizard__frame` (mirrors `.rc-frame` display-mode styling).
- **`src/components/islamic/ThresholdModal.jsx`** — added `synthesizeReflectionRows()` helper that pairs legacy `reflection.governing[i]` ↔ `notYet[i]` into row objects inheriting top-level `yesLabel`/`notYetLabel`, so every module with a flat reflection block gets `hasInteractiveReflection = true`. Render site passes `{ ...data.reflection, rows: reflectionRows }` so `ReadinessCheck`'s interactive guard fires. Changed `showClosingDuaStep` to `!isOpening && hasInteractiveReflection` (Closing Duʿāʾ always appears on closing, whether aligned or not); removed the `reflectionAllYes` finalize shortcut; simplified `handleNext` on Reflection to a plain `next()`.

**Decisions:**
- **Weekly tasks not deleted from source seeds** — the "weekly" items surfaced on midday-labor/morning Before/After are pulled dynamically by `buildTasksForNode` from `intellect-professional` / `wealth-earning` seed boards (e.g. "Define your professional mission statement" at `intellect-seed-tasks.js:6669`, rich Islamic educational content). Since Before/After no longer opens MirrorCard for these nodes, those tasks no longer double-surface — and they remain accessible in their original boards where their depth belongs. Deleting would have stripped substantive seed content.
- **Reflection rows synthesized, not authored** — rather than hand-authoring `reflection.rows` for 10+ modules, `synthesizeReflectionRows` derives rows from the legacy flat shape at the one read site. Modules that already have `reflection.rows` (community, moontrance-land, moontrance-seasonal) pass through untouched. Display-only `RCSection` fallback kept as a safety net even though it's effectively dead.
- **Closing Duʿāʾ is always shown** — framed as "how we mark the return," not a remedial step for misalignment. This required removing the Reflection-step finalize shortcut; the Reflection → Closing Duʿāʾ → Alhamdulillah path is now unconditional on closing threshold.

**Verified:**
- `npm run build` clean (1.34s, 2691 modules). Multiple intermediate builds during the session — all clean.

**Deferred:**
- Surfacing the Weekly boards in navigation (no UI entry point yet; reachable only via direct project routes).
- Per-row `attr` / `attr_ar` / `attrTitle` / `attrFrame` metadata on synthesized reflection rows — conditional render already handles absent `_attr` gracefully.

**Files changed:** `src/data/seed-tasks/weekly-seed-tasks.js` (new), `src/store/project-store.js`, `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx`, `src/components/islamic/ReadinessCheck.jsx`, `src/components/islamic/ReadinessCheck.css`, `src/components/islamic/ThresholdModal.jsx`.

## [2026-04-21] session | During hero → kanban migration (prayer slide-up)

**Completed:**
- **`src/data/seed-tasks/prayer-seed-tasks.js`** — inlined `PRAYER_GUIDE` (6 prayers × {structure rows, key reminders}) from the deleted `PrayerHeroDuring.jsx`; extended `buildPrayerSeedTasks()` with a during-populating pass: each structure row → `{title: "{kind} · {count} rakʿah(s)", subtasks:[{title: note}], priority: 'high', tags: ['salah','prayer-phase:during',\`prayer:${pillar}\`]}`; each `keys[]` string → `{title: key, priority: 'medium', tags: [...base, 'reminder']}`. Net seed counts per during board: fajr 4, dhuhr 5, asr 5, maghrib 5, isha 7, tahajjud 5.
- **`src/pages/shared/PrayerLevelPage.jsx`** — removed the `isDuring` branch + `PrayerHeroDuring` import; all three levels now render through the same `ProjectBoard` cross-fade layer.
- **`src/components/islamic/PrayerSlideUp.css`** — stripped `.pp-prayer-hero*` rule block (hero, window, guide, structure, struct-row/kind/count/note, keys, key, bismillah, name, subtitle, clock, colon, 560px media query). Kept `.pp-prayer-panel__body` + `> .fpb-page-wrapper` (still used by the panel layout).
- **Deleted:** `src/components/islamic/PrayerHeroDuring.jsx`.

**Decision:** seed tasks stay in TO DO only — IN PROGRESS/DONE remain empty by design, matching the Before/After convention and the `seedTasks()` invariant at `src/store/project-store.js:56`.

**Verified:**
- `npm run build` clean (1.58s, 2690 modules).
- Preview: Maghrib slide-up → switch to During → kanban renders with 5 TO DO cards ("Farḍ · 3 rakʿahs", "Sunnah after · 2 rakʿahs", "Pray promptly — Maghrib's window is the shortest of the day.", "No four-rakʿah farḍ here; its witr-count is the 3.", "If time allows before iqāmah, pray 2 light rakʿahs…"). IN PROGRESS/DONE empty as expected.
- `bbiz_tasks_prayer_*_during` keys written on first prayer-slide-up open via `ensurePrayerProjects` → `seedTasks` (idempotent).

**Deferred:** none.

**Files changed:** `src/data/seed-tasks/prayer-seed-tasks.js`, `src/pages/shared/PrayerLevelPage.jsx`, `src/components/islamic/PrayerSlideUp.css`, `src/components/islamic/PrayerHeroDuring.jsx` (deleted).

## [2026-04-21] session | Prayer slide-up → FLN carousel + 18 real prayer boards

**Completed:**
- **New FLN-based prayer dashboard** replacing the earlier tabs/list slide-up. Mockup source: `Prayer Dashboard Concept - Before.html`. Before/During/After are now *levels* (not tabs); 6 prayer pillars are segments within each level.
- **`src/data/prayer-pillars.js`** — new registry: `PRAYER_PILLARS` (fajr/dhuhr/asr/maghrib/isha/tahajjud), `PRAYER_LEVELS`, `PRAYER_PHASE_KEYS`, `PRAYER_LEVEL_COLORS`, `PRAYER_BOARD_PREFIX`, `PRAYER_BOARDS` (18 boards = 6 pillars × 3 phases, id pattern `prayer_{pillar}_{phase}`).
- **`src/data/seed-tasks/prayer-seed-tasks.js`** — Option-A duplication strategy: generic `prayer-phase:before|after` sunan from `faith_salah_{core,growth,excellence}` are duplicated across all 5 daily prayers' matching phase boards; prayer-specific (`prayer:X`) and transition-tagged (`transition:tahajjud-waking`, `transition:morning-adhkar`, etc.) tasks land only in their inferred home. Main-phase and untagged tasks stay in `faith_salah_*` untouched — non-destructive.
- **`src/store/project-store.js`** — added `ensurePrayerProjects` action (mirrors `ensureFaithProjects`), imports `PRAYER_SEED_TASKS`/`PRAYER_BOARDS`, registers `PRAYER_SEED_TASKS` in `ALL_SEEDS` for `backfillAndStripSeeds`.
- **`src/components/islamic/PrayerLevelNavigator.jsx`** — thin wrapper around shared `LevelNavigator` passing `PRAYER_PILLARS` + `PRAYER_LEVELS` + `PRAYER_STORAGE_KEY = 'prayer_active_phase'` + `PRAYER_ENSURE_PROJECTS` selector.
- **`src/pages/shared/PrayerLevelPage.jsx`** — clone of `PillarLevelPage` with controlled-mode `pillarKey`/`onPillarKeyChange`. Default level uses `pickDefaultLevel(pillarKey, timings, activePrayer)` via `usePrayerTimes` (before when prayer time not yet reached, during when active, after otherwise; tahajjud falls back to before). Renders `<PrayerHeroDuring>` when activeLevel==='during', else `<ProjectBoard>` with cross-fade.
- **`src/components/islamic/PrayerSlideUp.jsx`** (rewritten) — portal-based slide-up hosting `PrayerLevelPage`; keeps `pillarKey` in sync with `nodeId` prop and bubbles navigation via `onNavigate`.
- **`src/components/islamic/PrayerSlideUp.css`** — absorbed the `.pp-prayer-hero*` styles from the deleted old file (bismillah gold, tabular-nums clock); reuses `.pp-slideup__*` chrome from `ProjectSlideUp.css`.
- **Deleted:** old `PrayerSlideUp.{jsx,css}`, `PhaseTabs.jsx`, `PrayerStrip.jsx` — `PrayerHeroDuring.jsx` retained.

**Verified:**
- 18 `prayer_*` projects persist to `bbiz_projects`; 12 task boards seeded in `bbiz_tasks_prayer_*` (during boards empty by design).
- FLN renders 6 segments × 3 levels with task-colored subseg pills (10 pills visible at Before-Dhuhr).
- During hero: bismillah + "Dhuhr" + "It is time for prayer." + live `HH:MM` clock.
- Before/After: `ProjectBoard` dashboard renders with correct task counts per pillar×phase.
- `npm run build` clean (1.46s, 2691 modules); no new lint errors in prayer files.

**Deferred:**
- Real adhan-aware copy + rakah counter in the During hero (placeholder still reads "It is time for prayer.").

**Decisions filed:** `wiki/decisions/2026-04-21-prayer-slide-up-fln.md`

## [2026-04-21] session | MirrorCard Education → pillar submodules + Work project pillar tagging

**Completed:**
- **MirrorCard Education tab** (`src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx`) — EducationList rewritten to enumerate pillar-canonical submodules via `getPillarSubmoduleIds(pillarId)` from the submodule registry; cards reuse `.pp-project-row` styling. Dead `.pp-education-card*` CSS rules removed.
- **New `SubmoduleSlideUp` component** (`src/components/islamic/SubmoduleSlideUp.jsx`) — portal-rendered slide-up that hosts the canonical `PillarLevelPage` (Wealth/Life/Intellect/Family/Environment/Faith/Ummah) so the MirrorCard mirrors the standalone `/app/<submodule>` route pixel-for-pixel, including task click → TaskDetailPanel popup.
- **submodule-registry** (`src/data/submodule-registry.js`) — added Ummah pillar config + `community → ummah` alias via new `PILLAR_ALIASES` map; `getPillarSubmoduleIds` now resolves through the alias.
- **`buildUserProjectsForScope`** (`src/data/prophetic-path-submodules.js`) — replaced fragile `id.split('-')[0]` prefix heuristic with explicit `PILLAR_TO_SUBMODULES` table (correctly handles Ummah bare ids). User boards are matched whether tagged with a submodule `moduleId` or a pillar-only `moduleId`. Seeded pillar boards filtered out via `_<pillar>Module` flag.
- **`/app/work` New Project dialog** (`src/pages/modules/Work.jsx`) — Pillar + Submodule pickers added; selected submodule (or pillar if no submodule) persisted as `project.moduleId` via `createProject`. Listing filter extended to exclude `_ummahModule` seeded boards.
- **maqasid label fix** (`src/data/maqasid.js`) — `SUBMODULE_LABEL_OVERRIDES.collective` changed "Collective" → "Ummah" to match sidebar `UMMAH_PILLARS[0].label`.
- **TaskDetailPanel z-index** (`src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.css`) — `.tdp-overlay` raised 99 → 1100 so task detail popup renders above slide-up overlay (z-index 1000). Verified: COLLECTIVE-CORE task detail panel renders correctly above the Ummah slide-up.

**Decisions:** [[2026-04-21-project-pillar-tagging-submodule-slideup]]

**Deferred:** Edit-project flow for tagging legacy untagged projects — natural follow-up so pre-existing boards can join MirrorCard Action lists without manual recreation.

**Files changed:** `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx`, `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.css`, `src/components/islamic/SubmoduleSlideUp.jsx` (new), `src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.css`, `src/data/maqasid.js`, `src/data/prophetic-path-submodules.js`, `src/data/submodule-registry.js` (new), `src/pages/modules/Work.jsx`, `wiki/decisions/2026-04-21-project-pillar-tagging-submodule-slideup.md`, `wiki/entities/milos.md`, `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`.

**Commit:** `5fb95b7` pushed to origin/main.

## [2026-04-21] feat | PropheticPath — Morning & Isha-rest transition-sunnah phase buckets

**Completed:**
- **Source gathering:** Fresh NotebookLM Muslim Scholar round for transition sunnah (waking, morning adhkar, evening adhkar, pre-sleep, end-of-morning). Raw + rendered persisted at `tasks/notebook-prophet-transition-sunnah.json` + `-answer.md` for drift audit.
- **5 new parent tasks** (14 subtasks) authored in `faith_salah_core` with Amanah-Gate source blocks:
  - "Reclaim the day with the waking du'a and morning adhkar" — tags `prayer-phase:before`, `transition:waking`, `transition:morning-adhkar` (Bukhari 6312, Muslim 2723, Tirmidhi 3391, Muslim 670, Tirmidhi 586).
  - "Anchor the morning with Sayyid al-Istighfar and the daily-good du'a" — `prayer-phase:before`, `transition:morning-adhkar` (Bukhari 6306, Abu Dawud 5084).
  - "Recite the evening adhkar between Asr and Maghrib" — `prayer-phase:before`, `transition:evening-adhkar` (Muslim 2723, Abu Dawud 5082, Bukhari 2311).
  - "Complete the prophetic pre-sleep sunnah" — `prayer-phase:after`, `transition:pre-sleep` (Bukhari 2311/5017/6314, Tirmidhi 2891+2892, Muslim 2710).
  - "Close the morning by praying Dhuhr at its first time" — `prayer-phase:after`, `transition:end-of-morning` (Quran 4:103, Bukhari 527).
- **phaseMatchers added to `morning` node** + `faith-salah` added to its submodule scope in `src/data/prophetic-path-submodules.js`. `isha.phaseMatchers` extended with evening-adhkar + pre-sleep regexes.
- **Isha `phaseMatchers.after` tightened:** removed bare `dhikr|adhkar|istighfar|ayat al-kursi` keywords (the existing post-prayer adhkar seed task already carries `prayer-phase:after` tag, so keyword fallback was redundant and was leaking the evening-adhkar task into both Isha buckets).
- **Morning main matchers:** added title regex for "Close the morning" / "pray…Dhuhr…first time" because main-matcher pipeline is title-only (tags are scanned only at phase-filter stage).

**Verification (dev preview on port 5173, accessibility snapshots):**
- Morning Before → "Reclaim the day…", "Anchor the morning…" ✓
- Morning After → "Close the morning by praying Dhuhr at its first time" ✓
- Isha Before → pre-prayer sunnah, evening adhkar (new), Rawatib ✓ (no morning leak)
- Isha After → post-prayer adhkar, pre-sleep sunnah (new), muhasaba, prophetic supplications ✓ (no evening/morning leak)
- Screenshot tool unresponsive (30s timeout, no console errors); relying on accessibility-tree snapshots.

**Decisions:** [[2026-04-21-prophetic-transition-phase-tasks]]

**Follow-up (same session):** Tahajjud transition content authored — 2 new parent tasks in `faith_salah_core` ("Rise for Tahajjud with the prophetic waking protocol" × 4 subtasks; "Seal the night with the post-Witr adhkar and last-third du'a" × 3 subtasks). Citations: Bukhari 4569, 1154, 245, 1145; Muslim 255, 770, 758; Nasa'i 1733, 1745; Abu Dawud 1425, 1430; Tirmidhi 464. Tahajjud `phaseMatchers` extended with `transition:tahajjud-waking|post-witr` + specific keyword regexes. Main matchers narrowed (removed bare `du'a|supplication|guidance|decision`) to prevent morning-du'a task leak into Tahajjud pool. Preview-verified Tahajjud Before ("Rise for Tahajjud..." + pre-prayer sunnah) and After ("Seal the night..." + prophetic supplications). Artifact at `tasks/notebook-prophet-tahajjud-transition.md`.

**Deferred (closed same session):** Production `npm run build` ran clean (exit 0). Lint script authored at `scripts/lint-prayer-phase-tags.mjs` — asserts every parent task in `faith_salah_*` projects carries one of `prayer-phase:before|main|after|none`. Backfilled 12 existing main-bucket tasks (5 core, 4 growth, 3 excellence) with `prayer-phase:main` to make routing intent self-documenting. Lint now passes 23/23.

**Files changed:** `src/data/seed-tasks/faith-seed-tasks.js`, `src/data/prophetic-path-submodules.js`, `tasks/notebook-prophet-transition-sunnah.json`, `tasks/notebook-prophet-transition-sunnah-answer.md`, `wiki/decisions/2026-04-21-prophetic-transition-phase-tasks.md`, `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`.

## [2026-04-21] feat | PropheticPath — Prophetic sunnah tasks, phase-filtered Before/Main/After

**Completed:**
- **Source gathering:** NotebookLM Muslim Scholar (`1c17b03b-...`) queried for Prophet Muhammad's ﷺ practice before/during/after each of Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha, Tahajjud. Answer persisted at `tasks/notebook-prophet-prayers-answer.md` (6,917 chars, ~30 sahih citations — Bukhari 164/183/246/478/528/541/726/732/733/805/891/1130/1160/1916/2311/4723, Muslim 482/487/746/908/909/953/1198/1217/1226/1235/1241/1243/1428/1562/1575/1584/1632/1641/1671/1672/1689/1694/1697/1815/1820/4723; Quran 2:238, 5:6, 11:114, 17:78).
- **Seed tasks authored** in `src/data/seed-tasks/faith-seed-tasks.js` with full Amanah-Gate `sources`/`amanahRationale`/`tier` subtask blocks:
  - `faith_salah_core`: "Observe the pre-prayer sunnah before every salah (siwak, wudu, adhan response)" — 4 subtasks tagged `prayer-phase:before`.
  - `faith_salah_core`: "Complete the post-prayer adhkar after every salah (istighfar, tasbih, Ayat al-Kursi)" — 3 subtasks tagged `prayer-phase:after`.
  - `faith_salah_growth`: "Sit in remembrance after Fajr until sunrise (Ishraq reward)" — tagged `prayer-phase:after`, `prayer:fajr`.
  - `faith_salah_excellence`: "Memorise the prophetic supplications specific to each prayer" — 3 subtasks (Asr refuge-from-grave, Maghrib tahlil ×10, Witr Light Du'a).
- **Phase filter** added to `src/data/prophetic-path-submodules.js`: each prayer node now has `phaseMatchers: { before, after }`. `buildTasksForNode(nodeId, projects, tbp, { phase: 'before'|'main'|'after' })` filters rows by tag (`prayer-phase:before/after`) or keyword (siwak, wudu, adhan, rawatib, sutrah, tasbih, istighfar, Ayat al-Kursi, Ishraq, prophetic supplications, etc.). `main` returns the remainder (tasks that match neither before nor after).
- **UI rewire** in `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx`: Before button no longer opens Threshold modal (`setOpeningModuleId('faith-salah')` removed) — now calls `onToggle(node.id, 'before')` matching the After pattern. `tasksByNode` memo now returns `{ before, main, after }` per node via 3 `buildTasksForNode` calls. MirrorCard accepts a `phaseLabel` prop (BEFORE / NOW / AFTER) so the eyebrow reads "BEFORE · DAWN" etc.
- **Seed backfill migration** in `src/store/project-store.js`: `backfillAndStripSeeds()` extended to append new seed tasks (by title diff) to existing user boards so existing installs pick up the 4 new prophetic tasks without wiping state.
- **Regex fix:** `supplication` → `supplications?` across 7 matcher sites so plural form in the excellence task title matches.

**Verification (dev preview on port 5173):**
- All 18 prayer-node × phase buckets (Fajr/Dhuhr/Asr/Maghrib/Isha/Tahajjud × before/main/after) return ≥1 task via direct `buildTasksForNode` invocation against the hydrated store.
- Live UI snapshots confirmed for Fajr: BEFORE→"Learn the correct method of wudu", NOW→"Identify and eliminate any practices that contradict Tawhid", AFTER→"Complete the post-prayer adhkar" (with `prayer-phase:after` tag visible on the card).
- Screenshot tool unresponsive; relying on accessibility-tree snapshots. Production build not re-run this session.

**Decisions:** [[2026-04-21-prophetic-prayer-phase-tasks]]

**Deferred:** Morning/Isha-rest transition nodes (no phaseMatchers — main-only); production `npm run build` re-run; source-card visual verification for the new Amanah-Gate blocks.

**Files changed:** `src/data/seed-tasks/faith-seed-tasks.js`, `src/data/prophetic-path-submodules.js`, `src/components/islamic/PropheticPath.jsx`, `src/store/project-store.js`, `tasks/notebook-prophet-prayers-answer.md`, `wiki/decisions/2026-04-21-prophetic-prayer-phase-tasks.md`, `wiki/entities/milos.md`, `wiki/log.md`.

## [2026-04-21] session | Source/description reconciliation across all 7 pillars

**Completed:**
- **Phase 1 (detect):** `scripts/audit-source-refs.mjs` walks all 7 seed files, classifies source/description drift into buckets A (Quran refs missing from sources), B (hadith with full citation missing), C1 (uncited hadith claims), C2 (shorthand-cited hadith, lookup-able), D (low-confidence). Output: `artifacts/source-audit/*.jsonl` (555 findings total).
- **Phase 1.5 (promote):** `scripts/lookup-hadith-refs.mjs` batch-queries NotebookLM's Muslim Scholar notebook (Bukhari + Muslim + Quran PDFs, notebook `1c17b03b-...`) for each shorthand hadith citation. 70/128 C2 findings promoted to canonical `Collection + Number`; 58 unresolved.
- **Phase 2 (apply):** `scripts/apply-source-refs.mjs` aggregates mutations per subtask, anchors replacements by subtask title (tolerant of `\uXXXX` escapes and `\'` quote escapes), preserves quote-style semantics. Staged diff → `stages/source-audit/2026-04-21-review.md` (3,744 lines, 497 hunks). User-approved. Committed: **368 mutations** (78 Quran blocks inserted, 71 hadith blocks inserted, 299 uncited sentences removed) across all 7 pillars; 65 edge cases skipped (task-level source inserts unsupported by data shape; stale audit pointers in ummah).
- **Phase 3 (drift prevention):** `npm run audit:sources` script + baseline mode (`--write-baseline`, `--fail-on=increase`). Git pre-commit hook at `.githooks/pre-commit` activated via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Baseline snapshot stored at `artifacts/source-audit/.baseline.json` (138 residual high-conf findings; regressions block future commits).

**Also in this session (earlier turn):** Quran verse-range rendering fix — `TaskDetailPanel.jsx:530` regex widened to accept `X:Y-Z`, `QuranVerseCard.jsx` split into per-verse + range wrapper with stub fallback when `quranWBW` entry missing.

**Deferred:** (1) Manual review of 65 skipped edge cases in stage doc; (2) UI spot-check that new `### Quran/Hadith` headings render via `QuranEmbed`/`HadithCard`; (3) Grinding down the 138 residual high-conf baseline via further NotebookLM passes or manual citation.

**Decisions locked this session:** hybrid apply (auto-add high-conf, manual for ambiguous); uncited hadith sentences **removed** rather than flagged (covenant-grounded "no unattributed Prophet speech" rule).

**Files changed:** `scripts/{audit,lookup,apply}-source-refs.mjs`, `src/data/seed-tasks/*.js` (all 7), `src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.jsx`, `src/components/islamic/QuranVerseCard.jsx`, `package.json`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `artifacts/source-audit/**`, `stages/source-audit/2026-04-21-review.md`.

## [2026-04-20] session | Dashboard Wheel Test prototype — Maqasid Comparison Wheel

**Completed:**
- New standalone prototype module at `/app/dashboard-wheel-test` with sidebar entry (FlaskConical icon). Current Dashboard untouched.
- `MaqasidComparisonWheel.jsx` — pure custom SVG radial chart: hub + 5 annular-sector progress segments + outer colored label ring with curved `<textPath>` labels (auto-flip for bottom-half readability).
- `PathToExcellenceCards.jsx` — Foundation / Obligation / Aspiration cards with gold CTA stubs.
- Iterative visual refinement (~24 user turns) to match the mockup pixel-faithful per CLAUDE.md rule.

**Decisions:** [[2026-04-20-dashboard-wheel-test-prototype]]

**Key technical note:** Gradient fix — switched radialGradient from default `objectBoundingBox` to `gradientUnits="userSpaceOnUse"` + explicit `cx={CX} cy={CY} r={PROGRESS_MAX_R}` so the light source anchors at the wheel center rather than per-segment bounding box. Stops teal `#7fe3d0 → #0a2c30`.

**Deferred:** Store wiring for real pillar scores; other-pillar variants (Life/Intellect/Family/Wealth/Env/Ummah); promotion decision to replace current Dashboard; CTA wiring in Path to Excellence cards.

**Files changed:** `src/pages/prototypes/**`, `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`

**Commit:** `df3924b` pushed to main.

## [2026-04-20] fix | Salah Level 1 tasks missing — board re-seed race fixed

**Root cause:** `bbiz_tasks_faith_salah_core` was cleared from localStorage (likely during Siyam rename testing). AppShell preloads all projects on startup via `loadTasks`, caching `[]` for the board in the Zustand store. When the user visited the Salah board, `PillarLevelPage` effect-1 called `ensureFaithProjects → seedTasks` (re-seeding correctly to localStorage) but effect-2 (deps: `[projects]`) did NOT re-fire because the project entry was already in the store — leaving the store stale at `[]` even though localStorage was now seeded.

**Fix:** effect-1 now calls `useProjectStore.getState().projects` directly after `ensureProjectsFn()` and invokes `loadTasks` for all 3 level boards immediately, bypassing the projects-dep re-render dependency. effect-2 retained for new-project-entry path.

**Data restore:** cleared `bbiz_tasks_faith_salah_core` via DevTools → `seedTasks` re-seeded 5 Salah Level 1 tasks on next board visit.

**Files changed:** `src/pages/shared/PillarLevelPage.jsx`

## [2026-04-19] ui | PillarLevelDashboard — 3-Column Kanban + Dashboard Greeting Removed

**Completed:**
- `PillarLevelDashboard` task grid replaced from tag-group dividers to 3-column TO DO / IN PROGRESS / DONE kanban layout. Status derived from existing `doneColId`/`progressColId` column ID matching (no new data fields). Columns have colored header tints (neutral/amber/green). Empty columns show dashed placeholder. Insight card preserved below kanban. Responsive: stacks to 1 column on ≤900px.
- `insight-greeting` bar (avatar + name + Create Task / Start meeting / View Calendar) removed from `Dashboard.jsx`.

**Files changed:** `src/components/work/PillarLevelDashboard.jsx`, `src/components/work/PillarLevelDashboard.css`, `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

## [2026-04-19] feat | Amanah Grade Pipeline — Session 2 (multi-pillar)

Extended the Amanah Gate grading pipeline to cover remaining 6 pillars (life, family, intellect, wealth, environment, ummah).

**Completed:**
- Life pillar fully graded (236/236) and committed — stale-conversation fix enabled resumption
- Family grading active (98/233 committed, PS loop continuing)
- Fixed grade-amanah-tiers.mjs: stale-conversation sentinel (`turn_number:0`, empty answer) now auto-assigns T2 fallback without counting as failure — prevents infinite restart loops
- Rewrote grade-all-pillars.ps1: PowerShell self-restarting loop per pillar (replaces brittle cmd approach)
- Rewrote watch-and-apply.sh: polls jsonl row counts (no run.log dependency), commits+pushes each pillar on completion
- Diagnosed: exit-1 failures mid-session were transient rate-limiting on alt-auth account; recovered after ~6 hours

**Active at session close:** family grader running via grade-all-pillars.ps1 (98→233); watcher bb9caslx2 standing by to commit intellect→ummah in sequence.

**Deferred:** intellect (236), wealth (236), environment (226), ummah (450) — grading continues automatically in detached PS process.

## [2026-04-19] feat | Sanctuary Mode — Level-Gating

Two-part earned-unlock system layered onto Dashboard Sanctuary Mode.

**Dashboard (FocusTaskList):** Deep Work now filtered to the user's effective level — `niyyahLevel` if set, otherwise the lowest incomplete level from `getSubmoduleActiveLevel`. Level eyebrow chip ("Level 1 · Foundation" etc.) added to FocusTaskList header. `getFocusTasks` signature extended to `(submoduleId, level)`.

**Niyyah intention setter (NiyyahAct):** Per-submodule level badge (L1/L2/L3) rendered in the submodule picker. "↑ Advance to Growth/Excellence" affordance appears only when `getPillarLevelProgress` confirms every leveled submodule in the pillar has completed the current level — enforcing pillar-advances-together rule. Tapping bumps that submodule's level for the session; saved via `completeNiyyah({ …, level })`.

**Store changes:** `task-store.js` — added `getProjectLevel`, `getLevelStatus`, `getSubmoduleActiveLevel`, `getPillarLevelProgress`. `threshold-store.js` — `niyyahLevel` field persisted at `thr_niyyah_level`, cleared on rollover/skip, archived in history entries.

Verified: build passes (2668 modules); level badges visible in picker; FocusTaskList shows correct level chip and filters tasks to `_core` projects only; `niyyahLevel` written to localStorage on save.

Known gap: `continueYesterday` echo prefill does not restore yesterday's advanced level — deferred.

## [2026-04-19] rename | Sawm → Siyam across active source

Fourth pillar of Islam renamed from "Sawm" (صَوْم) to "Siyam" (صِيَام) — the Qur'anic prescribed-fasting form (2:183). `FaithLevelNavigator` already used "Siyam"; this change aligns the rest of the stack.

- Module id: `faith-sawm` → `faith-siyam` (modules.js, maqasid.js, App.jsx route + moduleId, Sidebar MODULE_ROUTES)
- Page file: `FaithSawmPage.jsx` → `FaithSiyamPage.jsx`; function + `pillarKey="siyam"`
- Store project ids: `faith_sawm_{core,growth,excellence}` → `faith_siyam_*`; names + descriptions capitalised SIYAM
- Seed tasks: keys, section header, tags (`['sawm', …]` → `['siyam', …]`), five-pillars list strings
- Islamic data: `faith-sawm` / `faith_sawm` / `sawm:` keys in islamic-data.js, ayah-banner-data.js, pillar-dashboard-data.js, five-pillars-content.js (Arabic updated from الصَّوْم → الصِيَام)
- Scripts: generate-faith-csv.mjs, rerank-hadith-candidates.mjs (topic id `faith/sawm` → `faith/siyam`; kept `sawm` in tokenizer whitelist alongside `siyam`)
- Preserved literal Qur'anic quote in faith-seed-tasks.js line 4209 (Maryam 19:26 uses `صَوْمًا`, not `صِيَامًا`) and the `sawm` glossary alias entry in islamic-glossary.js
- Intentionally NOT changed: `graphify-out/`, `artifacts/`, `stages/`, prior `wiki/log.md` entries — frozen historical records
- Store migration: accepted reset for `faith_sawm_*` → `faith_siyam_*` (dev env, single user)
- Verified: `npm run build` passes; grep on src/ returns only the glossary alias and the preserved Qur'anic quote

## 2026-04-19 — Ummah Pillar Split → Ummah + Moontrance

**Objective:** Split the single Ummah pillar (7 sub-modules) into two independent pillars: Ummah (social/community) and Moontrance (land/residency).

**Completed:**
- `src/data/maqasid.js` — Trimmed ummah `subModuleIds` to `['collective', 'neighbors', 'community']`; changed ummah `relationship` to `'self-contained'`; added new `moontrance` pillar (order: 8, icon: Moon, accentColor: #6E8E5B, arabicRoot: Hifz al-Ard, subModuleIds: moontrance-land/seasonal/residency, relationship: moontrance-atlas)
- `src/styles/tokens.css` — Added `--pillar-moontrance` / `--pillar-moontrance-bg` / `--pillar-moontrance-border` in both light and dark `:root` blocks
- `src/pages/moontrance/MoontraceDashboard.jsx` — New Moontrance pillar dashboard (milestones, sub-module cards, frameworks, OLOS bridge); reuses UmmahDashboard.css classes
- `src/pages/moontrance/MoontraceLevelNavigator.jsx` — Level navigator for the 3 Moontrance sub-modules
- `src/pages/ummah/UmmahDashboard.jsx` — Stripped moontrance content; now shows only collective/neighbors/community + their frameworks
- `src/pages/ummah/UmmahLevelNavigator.jsx` — Removed moontrance-* entries from UMMAH_PILLARS
- `src/App.jsx` — Imported MoontraceDashboard; added `pillar/moontrance` route
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx` — Added Moon to PILLAR_ICON_MAP
- `src/components/dashboard/PillarCard.jsx` — Added Moon import + PILLAR_ICON_MAP entry
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` — Fixed pillar resolution: prefer moduleId match over id.startsWith to prevent double-counting
- `src/components/dashboard/PillarProgressStrip.jsx` — Same resolution fix (moduleId first, id prefix fallback)

**Key decisions:**
- Board IDs (ummah_moontrance-*) intentionally NOT renamed — resolution fix via moduleId preference makes renaming unnecessary and avoids localStorage migration risk
- Moontrance readinessAyatKey temporarily reuses 'community'; dedicated ayat data deferred
- MoontraceDashboard imports UmmahDashboard.css for layout classes (shared, no duplication)

**Deferred:** Add dedicated Moontrance readiness ayat; add moontrance entry to pillar-content.js for generic PillarDashboard; update CONTEXT.md routing files.


## 2026-04-19 — Amanah Gate Tier Grading — Faith Pilot

**Objective:** Grade all 212 Faith subtasks with T1/T2/T3 Amanah evidence tiers and surface badges + rationale in the UI.

**Completed:**
- Built `scripts/grade-amanah-tiers.mjs` — resumable NotebookLM grader (alt-auth `be921648`, 4-concurrent, JSONL output)
- Built `scripts/apply-amanah-tiers.mjs` — idempotent apply script using bracket/brace-depth tracking to insert `tier` + `amanahRationale` into subtask objects only (not task-level objects)
- Added `scripts/run-grader.cmd` — detached Windows launcher for long-running grading sessions
- Created `src/data/config/amanah-tiers.js` — T1 Bayyinah (green), T2 Qarina (amber), T3 Aspiration (purple)
- Created `src/components/shared/AmanahTierBadge.jsx` — inline badge mirroring GLabelBadge pattern
- Updated `src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.jsx` — badge in subtask row, subtask-detail header, and Sources rationale block
- Updated `src/services/seed-hydrator.js` — hydrate/strip `tier` + `amanahRationale` from localStorage
- Graded 212 Faith subtasks (193 NotebookLM + 19 conservative T2 fallbacks for empty-answer rows). Distribution: T1:11, T2:158, T3:43
- Wrote `artifacts/amanah-grading/faith.jsonl` — 212 rows with grade, tier, rationale, gradedAt

**Key decisions:**
- Tiers are T1/T2/T3 (Bayyinah/Qarina/Aspiration) — not BBOS G-labels (different system)
- Rationale is embedded in seed data and rendered in the Sources slide-in view above the trust banner
- Alt-auth NotebookLM (`be921648`, env: `~/.notebooklm-alt`) used — default `1c17b03b` rate-limited

**Deferred:** Grade remaining 6 pillars (life 236, family 233, intellect 236, wealth 236, environment 226, ummah 450) in subsequent sessions.

## [2026-04-18] grounding | Faith session B — 17 shahada_core subtasks graded (ledger 32/212)

### Completed
- Adopted runtime; ran §3 Session Initialization from continuity block; user approved execution plan.
- **Phase 1 (retrieval):** first attempt to resume driver hit the same NotebookLM rate-limit wall as session A (RPC 429 on MS primary `1c17b03b…`). User provided two high-rate-limit notebook copies under a different Google account: MS=`be921648-2088-4860-bdd8-283a5e7301f3`, CS=`5191ba7b-142c-436c-b967-86a5aa6d0f28`. Alt copies initially returned RPC `GET_NOTEBOOK` null-result errors — traced to auth (different Google account). Installed Playwright Chromium, ran `notebooklm login` with `NOTEBOOKLM_HOME=.notebooklm-alt` to isolate the alt auth/profile. Verified both notebooks return real citations under alt auth.
- Driver extended with `MILOS_NOTEBOOKLM_HOME` env-var override (passes `NOTEBOOKLM_HOME` to subprocess env) and hardcoded default notebook IDs flipped to the alt copies. Relaunched successfully — completed retrieval for all 14 remaining queued subtasks + re-retrieved 2 stragglers (`[3].subtasks[1..2]` whose session-A raws were 148-byte error blobs).
- **Phase 2 (assembly):** dispatched 2 parallel `general-purpose` assembly subagents (batches 7+7) + 1 cleanup subagent for the 2 stragglers. All 16 subtasks: `[3].subtasks[1..5]`, `[4].subtasks[0..3]`, `[5].subtasks[0..6]` plus `[3].subtasks[1..2]` re-done. All 16 returned `status: graded`, `groundedBar: yes`, no rejections to `insufficient`.
- **Phase 3 (merge):** appended 16 new records to `tasks/grounding-progress.json` → ledger now at 32/212 (includes pilot `[0][0]`). Lint re-run unchanged on shape.array (patch emission still deferred per runtime §6).
- Memory updated: `reference_notebooklm_grounding.md` now documents the alt-account high-rate-limit copies and the `MILOS_NOTEBOOKLM_HOME` env-var override.

### Deferred
- **180 of 212 faith subtasks still unretrieved** across 14 modules beyond `shahada_core` (`shahada_heart`, `shahada_tongue`, `shahada_action`, `tawhid_*`, `qadar_*`, `iman_*`, `ihsan_*`, etc. — see `artifacts/grounding-pilot/faith-queue.json`).
- **Patch emission to `src/data/seed-tasks/faith-seed-tasks.js` still deferred** — emitted once the full pillar is graded, not per-session. Linter delta unchanged: `byShape.array=0/212`, `byGroundedBar.yes=0/212`.
- **Query-template hardening**: still need to revise CS prompt to force paired ref+matn output from MS for hadith (same gap noted in session A).
- **Session-A straggler pattern**: the driver's skip-if-all-3-files-exist logic skipped over the 2 stragglers even though those files were 148-byte error blobs. Consider adding a size/error-content check to the skip logic so future sessions don't mask prior failures.

### Why it mattered
Unblocked the rate-limit wall that capped session A. Alt-account notebook copies deliver high enough throughput to finish retrieval for an entire module in a single session (16 subtasks retrieved end-to-end in ~15 min). Pattern validated: a single session can retrieve + assemble ~16 subtasks cleanly when the primary bottleneck (API quota) is removed.

### Recommended next session
Pick the next shahada module (`shahada_heart` or `shahada_tongue`) and run the same pattern: retrieve via driver under alt auth → split into 2–3 parallel assembly subagents → merge records. Consider enumerating all of `shahada_*` into one batch (likely 4×6 ≈ 24 subtasks) since alt auth has headroom. Eventually need a single larger session to emit the seed-file patch once most of faith is graded.

### Decision filed
- None this session — procedural (auth/infra) work only.

## [2026-04-18] grounding | Faith session A — 15 shahada_core subtasks graded via LLM assembly

### Completed
- Adopted runtime; ran §3 Session Initialization from continuity block; user approved execution plan.
- **Phase 1:** backfilled `tasks/grounding-progress.json` with prior pilot record `faith.faith_shahada_core[0].subtasks[0]`.
- **Phase 2 (spot-check):** dispatched LLM assembly subagent for `[0].subtasks[1..3]`. Subagent respected hard rules (no regex ref-matching, direct quotation only, ref↔matn integrity, corpus discipline). 3 entries written; subagent surfaced rejections explicitly (e.g. dropped Quran 49:14/5:41 because MS flagged Arabic as "Not from sources" and refs pointed to 49:15 instead).
- **Phase 3:** human spot-check — user approved methodology with 4 policy answers: (1) missing-Arabic tolerated when MS didn't return it, (2) bind to what MS returned not what query asked for, (3) 2-entry subtasks acceptable if grounded-bar passes, (4) mark such subtasks `graded` not `needs-review`.
- **Phase 4:** dispatched 2 parallel assembly subagents for remaining 11 retrieved subtasks (`[1][0..3]`, `[2][0..6]`, `[3][0]`). All 12 entries written to `artifacts/grounding-pilot/entries/`, all grounded-bars pass, all rejections documented in subagent reports.
- **Phase 5 (in flight):** retrieval driver resumed in background for remaining 16 shahada_core subtasks.
- **15 progress ledger records** written — pilot [0][0] + 14 new (`[0][1..3]`, `[1][0..3]`, `[2][0..6]`, `[3][0]`).

### Deferred
- 16 of 31 shahada_core subtasks still need retrieval (driver running as of session close); assembly for those follows in next session.
- 0 subtasks migrated to structured-array shape in `src/data/seed-tasks/faith-seed-tasks.js`. Linter delta: `byShape.array` unchanged 0/212; `groundedBar.yes` unchanged 0/212 (entries live in `artifacts/grounding-pilot/entries/` as pre-merge grading data; patch emission to seed file is a later phase).
- Query-template hardening: multiple subtasks had q2 where MS quoted hadith matn without inlining canonical Bukhari/Muslim refs — assembler correctly rejected, but the query template should be revised to require paired ref+matn emission.
- Other shahada modules beyond `shahada_core` (3 others in module list) not yet touched.

### Why it mattered
Validated that LLM-driven assembly preserves ref↔matn integrity where the regex assembler failed. The subagents rejected citations with loose binding (e.g. refs without inline matn, MS disclaimers on Arabic) rather than fabricate. Confirmed Opus 4.7's literalism handles the 10-rule prompt reliably when the template entry and a worked example are both provided as context.

### Recommended next session
Check retrieval-driver completion (see `artifacts/grounding-pilot/retrieve-log-session-faith-a.txt`); assemble the newly retrieved 16 subtasks using the same 2-subagent split pattern (balanced batches of ~8). Then move to the next shahada module in the queue. Consider revising retrieval query template to force paired ref+matn output from MS.

## [2026-04-18] chore | Grounding runtime — Faith pilot session (infra only, no merges)

### Completed
- Adopted `docs/grounding-runtime-prompt.md`; ran §3 Session Initialization; user approved execution plan for Faith pillar (212 subtasks, Option A: 3 queries/subtask).
- Created branch `grounding/faith` to isolate emitted patch from dirty working tree (graphify-out, website artifacts).
- Initialized `tasks/grounding-progress.json` (empty records).
- Wrote `scripts/grounding-enumerate.mjs` — emits idPath queue from a pillar seed file. Produced `artifacts/grounding-pilot/faith-queue.json` (212 entries across 15 modules).
- **Pilot subtask graded end-to-end**: `faith.faith_shahada_core[0].subtasks[0]` ("Recite the full Shahada…"). 4 `GroundingSource` entries (Quran 47:19 + 48:29; Bukhari 8 + Muslim 20); grounded-bar passes. Entry file: `artifacts/grounding-pilot/pilot-entry-shahada-core-0-0.json`. User confirmed shape.
- Built retrieval driver `scripts/grounding-retrieve-batch.py` with inter-call pacing (5s) and exponential backoff (30/90/180s) on rate-limit errors. 15 of 31 remaining shahada_core subtasks have complete clean raw retrievals under `artifacts/grounding-pilot/raw/` (`*-cs.json`, `*-ms-q1.json`, `*-ms-q2.json`, `*-meta.json`).
- Windows mechanics captured: `/c/Python314/python -m notebooklm …`; `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` mandatory; `--json` to file (never stdout — Arabic crashes cp1252).

### Deferred
- **Entry assembly requires LLM judgement, not regex.** Subagent-built `scripts/grounding-assemble-batch.py` emitted 4 entries that misattributed hadith refs (Bukhari 8 ≠ its actual matn; every hadith off-by-one). All 4 entry files purged; `progress.json` records cleared. Script kept on disk as a warning artifact — do not use.
- 16 of 31 shahada_core subtasks still without raw retrievals (driver hit rate-limit loop mid-batch; backoff patch in place, resumable).
- 0 subtasks migrated to structured-array shape in `src/data/seed-tasks/faith-seed-tasks.js`. No patch emitted. Linter delta: `faith.byShape.array` unchanged at 0/212; `groundedBar.yes` unchanged at 0/212.

### Why it mattered
Pilot established that (a) the 3-query retrieval loop works and produces clean primary-source data, (b) judgement cannot be delegated to regex — hadith-ref ↔ matn binding needs a model that reads the text, and (c) Google NotebookLM enforces rate limits that require backoff even at 3 calls/subtask.

### Recommended next session
Resume on branch `grounding/faith`. Finish retrieval (16 subtasks left), then dispatch tightly-scoped LLM assembly subagents (4–6 subtasks each, strict "quote directly from raw MS outputs, no regex ref-matching") starting with `faith_shahada_core[0].subtasks[1..3]` as the spot-check batch.

## [2026-04-18] feat | MILOS universal grounding — Phase 0 complete

### What was done
- `docs/grounding-schema.md` — formalised the `sources[]` structured entry shape. Two-axis resolution: `provenanceTier` (Amanah Gate Protocol, unchanged) + `relevance: direct|contextual|thematic`. Niyyah-blocks rule restated. Legacy Markdown-string shape documented for migration.
- `scripts/lint-grounding.mjs` — read-only conformance linter. Baseline: 1,829 subtasks across 7 pillars, all `shape=string`, zero missing, zero errors.
- `docs/grounding-runtime-prompt.md` — operational runtime prompt for grading sessions. Dual-corpus discipline (Muslim Scholar `1c17b03b` for citations; Claude Scholar `91d2bd2b` for query-craft). Pillar-boundary session atoms; 500K-token safety net for Opus 4.7 [1m]. §9 Session Continuity Block — 5-part literal paste-able handover prompt generated at every session end.
- `wiki/references/notebooklm-grounding-corpora.md` + `wiki/index.md` — both corpora registered.
- `wiki/decisions/2026-04-18-milos-grounding-two-axis.md` — ADR for two-axis schema.
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — MUSLIM_SCHOLAR + CLAUDE_SCHOLAR added to legacy notebook registry.
- Memory: `reference_notebooklm_grounding.md` added to MEMORY.md.

### Linter counts (authoritative)
Faith 212 · Life 236 · Intellect 236 · Family 233 · Wealth 236 · Environment 226 · Ummah 450 · **Total 1,829**

### Why
Unstructured Markdown-string `sources` fields on 1,829 subtasks cannot be machine-verified, tier-graded, or surface a `relevance` axis on the Sources card. Phase 0 establishes the schema and tooling before any grading runs.

### Session Debrief
**Completed:** Phase 0 — schema, linter, runtime prompt, corpus registration, two-axis ADR.
**Deferred:** Phase 1 (worklist harness + dry-run on 5 Faith subtasks); Phases 2–7 (grading + website rollout).
**Recommended next session:** Phase 1 — build `scripts/ground-subtasks.mjs` worklist generator, dry-run pipeline end-to-end on 5 Faith subtasks, generate a sample Session Continuity Block.

## [2026-04-18] feat | Amanah Gate Protocol — universal Bayyinah/Qarina/Niyyah tier labels

### What was done
- Created `wiki/concepts/amanah-gate-protocol.md` — canonical spec for the three-tier evidence system with conformance test for future products.
- Updated `wiki/concepts/amanah-gate.md` to reference the new spec and show the universal tier table.
- Added `[[amanah-gate-protocol]]` to `wiki/index.md`.
- Website: replaced product-specific labels (G1–G4, High/Medium/Low) with Bayyinah/Qarina/Niyyah on BBOS solution, OLOS solution, and hub. Added cross-product callout block to both solution pages. Added "Amanah Gate Protocol" section to hub `index.html`.
- MILOS app: updated `src/data/config/g-labels.js` — label fields now read Bayyinah/Bayyinah/Qarina/Niyyah (G1/G2 internal ids preserved). Updated `GLabelBadge.jsx` to render `g.label` instead of `g.id`.

### Why
- G1–G4, High/Medium/Low, and M1–M3 were three independent implementations of the same pattern. Unifying on three Islamic epistemological terms (Bayyinah = verified, Qarina = inferred, Niyyah = declared) makes the Amanah Gate Protocol a legible cross-product standard, not a coincidence.

## [2026-04-18] refactor | Product rename — Maqasid OS → MILOS, Moontrance → MTC, Atlas → OLOS

### What was done
- Website (ogden-hub subtree): reordered ecosystem hub to MILOS → MTC → OLOS → BBOS, added per-product journey one-liners, renamed folder paths (`/maqasid/` → `/milos/`, `/moontrance/` → `/mtc/`, `/atlas/` → `/olos/`), renamed CSS custom properties and class selectors site-wide.
- App text surfaces: `\bMaqasid OS\b` → MILOS, `\bMoontrance\b` → MTC, `\bAtlas\b` (product noun) → OLOS across `src/`, `docs/`, `wiki/`, `CLAUDE.md`. Islamic concept "Maqasid" preserved (only " OS" suffixed form matched).
- Wiki file renames: `entities/maqasid-os.md` → `milos.md`, `entities/atlas.md` → `olos.md`; all `[[maqasid-os]]` and `[[atlas]]` links rewritten.
- Preserved: `atlas/` submodule directory name, `onaxyzogden/atlas` repo slug, Zustand `bbiz_` storage keys, app working directory `MAQASID OS - V2.1`.

### Why
- Shorter acronyms align product surface with everyday reference ("MILOS" beats "Maqasid OS V2.1" in nav, copy, and speech).
- Hub reorder puts personal OS first, business OS last — mirrors user's priority stack.

### Commits
- Phase 1: `3a8f679` (hub reorder + one-liners)
- Phase 2: `4c26e1f` (website text + CSS vars)
- Phase 3: `e9ff0e5` (website folder rename)
- Phase 4: this commit (app rename)

## [2026-04-17] feat | Full end-to-end onboarding experience

### What was done
- **5-step wizard revamp** at `/get-started`: Welcome ("Peace be upon you.") → Profile + Intent micro-survey → Pillar Focus (Bento-style cards) → Values Framing (Islamic Governance vs Universal Ethics) → First Action (Level 1 submodule navigator with optimistic selection).
- **OnboardingChecklist widget**: collapsible 5-item Dashboard card (Set up profile → First task → Explore Sources → Add pillar → Weekly review), progress bar, Masha'Allah celebration state, persistent dismissal.
- **SpotlightTour**: 3-step cutout overlay (box-shadow technique) for first Dashboard visit — highlights sidebar, main area, and checklist. Dismissed permanently via onboarding-store.
- **PillarFirstEntry modals**: just-in-time modal on first navigation to any pillar page, per-pillar persistence via `seenPillars` in store. Accent-color header, 2-sentence description, 3 module bullets.
- **onboarding-store**: new Zustand store using `safeGet`/`safeSet` pattern for all onboarding state.
- `data-tour` attributes added to Sidebar nav and Dashboard.
- `@keyframes onboardingFadeUp` + `.onboarding-fade-up` class added to `landing.css`.

### Files created/modified
- `src/store/onboarding-store.js` (created)

- `6e25ef8` — feat: Settings section to Disable / Reset onboarding hints (disableOnboarding + resetOnboarding store actions)

### Deferred
- Fresh-user walk-through: clear localStorage, run full wizard in browser, confirm tour + checklist + pillar modal render correctly.

---

## [2026-04-17] chore | Sidebar icon refresh (6 swaps)

### What was done
Live-element-driven icon swaps in the sidebar:
- Projects (`work`): `Kanban` → `PencilRuler`
- Assets (`money`): `Wallet` → `Landmark`
- **Wealth pillar**: `Coins` → `ChessRook` (updated across 6 `PILLAR_ICON_MAP` sites: Sidebar, MobileNav, PillarCard, Landing, TodayFocusSection, Onboarding)
- Earning & Provision (`wealth-earning`): `Wallet` → `GitPullRequestCreateArrow`
- Financial Literacy (`wealth-financial`): `PiggyBank` → `ChessKnight`
- Tech (`tech`): `Shield` → `SquareTerminal`

### Files touched
- `src/data/modules.js` — icon string updates
- `src/data/maqasid.js` — wealth pillar icon
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx` — lucide-react imports + ICON_MAP/PILLAR_ICON_MAP
- `src/components/layout/MobileNav.jsx`, `src/components/dashboard/PillarCard.jsx`, `src/pages/Landing.jsx`, `src/pages/TodayFocusSection.jsx`, `src/pages/Onboarding.jsx` — ChessRook added to each pillar icon map

### Verified
Each swap confirmed in live preview via DOM class check (`lucide-pencil-ruler`, `lucide-landmark`, `lucide-chess-rook`, `lucide-git-pull-request-create-arrow`, `lucide-chess-knight`, `lucide-square-terminal`).

### Deferred
Uncommitted — left in working tree alongside unrelated prior changes.

## [2026-04-17] feat | Divine-attribute bodies rewritten to three-layer comprehensibility pattern

### What was done
- **Problem**: The Threshold Ceremony's Attributes step showed a single dense theological paragraph per divine Name — inaccessible to a general audience and missing any scriptural anchor.
- **Pattern established**: Every `attrs[*].body` in `MODULE_ATTRS` (`src/data/islamic/islamic-data.js`) now follows three layers separated by `\n\n`:
  1. **Elementary explanation** — plain-language description of the Name (child-accessible)
  2. **Contextual application** — preserved/lightly edited from the prior body, tying the Name to the specific submodule
  3. **`Source:` line** — scriptural reference with short excerpt on its own paragraph
- **CSS support**: Added `white-space: pre-line` to `.attr-card-body` in `AttributeCard.css` so `\n\n` renders as paragraph breaks inside the existing `<p>` tag.
- **Coverage**: 93 bodies rewritten across 47 modules (Work/Money/People/Office/Tech, MTC, Faith + 7 sub-pillars, Life, People submodules, Family + 5 submodules, Ummah + neighbors + community, Wealth + 4 submodules, Environment + 4 submodules, `collective` land module). Elementary paragraphs sourced from `99_names_of_allah.html` `kid` field for standard 99; authored for ~8 non-standard names (Al-Muhsin, Al-Qarib, Al-Jamil, Ash-Shafi, Ar-Rabb, Aṭ-Ṭāhir, Al-Mudabbir, Al-Muḥsin-variant).
- **Verified**: grep `^\s*body: '(?!.*Source:)` returns zero matches; `npm run build` passes in 1.38s.

### Deferred
- Live browser spot-check of 3 ceremonies (salah-core, moontrance-land, family-parenting) to confirm three-layer rendering.
- `UNIVERSAL_EQUIV` secular-operator principles — different register, separate session.

## [2026-04-17] fix | IslamicPanel stale module content on navigation

### What was done
- **Root cause**: `activeModule` in app-store was only updated by sidebar submodule `<Link onClick>` — all other navigation paths (browser back/forward, pillar header clicks, in-page links) left it stale, causing IslamicPanel to show the previous module's dua, attrs, and readiness content.
- **Fix**: Added a `useEffect` in `AppShell.jsx` watching `location.pathname`. Extracts the first path segment after `/app/` and calls `setActiveModule(segment)` for all non-pillar, non-settings routes. Single file change, ~10 lines.
- **Verified** in preview: navigating `faith-salah → life-physical` via URL (bypassing sidebar click) correctly updates panel to Life · Physical Health content.

### Commits
- `4818c67` — fix(islamic-panel): sync activeModule from URL on every navigation

## [2026-04-16] feat | V3.2 adab refactor — contextual gates; trust banner; reviewer brief

### What was done
- **Adab correction (critical)**: refactored `AYAH_BLACKLIST` (30 entries) and `HADITH_BLACKLIST` (26 entries) in `scripts/rerank-hadith-embeddings.mjs` into `AYAH_CONTEXTUAL_GATES` / `HADITH_CONTEXTUAL_GATES`. Every authentic ayah and Sahih hadith is revelation; global vetoes are an adab violation. Gates now affirm each citation's true topical subject via keyword lists — a citation passes on subtasks whose title matches the topic, without ever declaring the revelation itself problematic. Re-score produced 289 blocks (vs 287 with blacklists — coverage effectively unchanged).
- **Scholar-lens review** of 322 blocks: identified gold-standard exemplars (Muhabbah 3:31, Ayat al-Dayn, Surah Al-Ma'un, Shu'ayb's daughter on hiring), 22 critical errors (e.g., 2:258 Nimrud debate mis-paired with Ibrahim's sacrifice), paradise/eschatology false-positive cluster, and fiqh leak (2:235 iddah verse unguarded). Document: `stages/hadith-scholar-review-review.md`.
- **UI trust banner split** in `src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.jsx`: amber "Suggestive reference — pending scholar review" banner by default, green "Scholar-reviewed" affirmation when `activeSubtask.sourcesTrust === 'scholar-reviewed'`.
- **External reviewer brief** drafted at `stages/scholar-reviewer-brief-review.md`: defines ~10-hour engagement for 289 blocks at ~30 blocks/hr, verdict taxonomy (approve/reject/revise/defer), and reviewer scope (pairing fit, not ijazah or fatwa).
- **Feedback memory** persisted: never globally veto authentic revelation; use contextual pairing gates instead. `memory/feedback_no_blacklist_revelation.md`.

### Commits
- `b85b821` — refactor blacklists to contextual gates
- `282d65e` — feat(sources): trust banner in sources view
- `9371db2` — docs(sources): scholar reviewer brief + internal review

### Deferred
- Visual preview verification of the trust banner inside an open subtask sources panel.
- Outreach to a qualified reviewer.
- Per-pillar coverage-vs-quality audit across the 289 retained blocks.

## [2026-04-17] feat | Dual-component source completion — Quran + Hadith for all 1829 subtasks

### What was done
- Audited all 7 pillar seed files against `stages/_review-[pillar].txt` for single-component sources (Quran-only or Hadith-only).
- Found 219 gaps: 53 subtasks missing Quran section, 166 subtasks missing Hadith section.
- Dispatched 7 parallel subagents (one per pillar) in two waves to fill gaps.
- Each agent used quran.ai MCP (`fetch_quran`, `search_quran`, ar-simple-clean + en-abdel-haleem) for Arabic + translation, and WebSearch/sunnah.com for Sahih hadith text.
- Applied indirect-evidence rule for logistical subtasks (no direct ayah/hadith): cited the nearest governing command with an italicised contextual note.
- Agents also backfilled blank `**Arabic:**` fields within previously-added Quran sections, and fixed pre-existing curly-quote JS syntax errors in `faith-seed-tasks.js` and `life-seed-tasks.js`.
- Final build: `✓ built in 1.52s` — 0 errors.

### Gap summary
| Pillar | Gaps | A:- filled | H:- filled |
|--------|------|-----------|-----------|
| Faith | 62 | 9 | 53 |
| Ummah | 48 | 14 | 34 |
| Family | 29 | 9 | 20 |
| Life | 28 | 7 | 21 |
| Wealth | 22 | 6 | 16 |
| Environment | 15 | 3 | 12 |
| Intellect | 15 | 5 | 10 |

### Definition of done
Every subtask now either cites a direct Quranic ayah and/or Sahih hadith in full rich-text format (Arabic + English + grade), or cites the nearest governing command as contextual/indirect evidence with an explanatory note.

### Next steps
- Scholar review pass should now include the newly added Hadith sections (contextual-evidence entries especially).
- See `stages/_review-[pillar].txt` — headers updated to reflect completion.

## [2026-04-16] feat | Sources parity — 1829/1829 subtasks with Quran/hadith references

### What was done
- Achieved 100% `sources` field coverage across all 7 seed files (1,829 subtasks total).
- Baseline was ~16% coverage (289 of 1,829 subtasks had sources from prior V3/V3.1 enrichment).
- Built 3-stage pipeline: extract-missing-sources manifest → parallel agent generation → title-matching injection.
- Dispatched 18 sub-agents across 3 rounds (R1: 8 agents / 693 entries, R2: 9 agents / 885 entries, R3: 1 agent / 23 entries).
- Agents used quran.ai MCP server for canonical Arabic text (ar-simple-clean + en-sahih-international editions).
- Wrote `inject-sources-v2.mjs` with unicode-escape-aware title matching to handle `\u2014` (em dash) and `\u02bf` (ʿ) in file text.
- +15,202 lines added across 7 files. Build passes clean.

### Coverage
| Pillar | Subtasks | Sources |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Faith | 212 | 212 |
| Life | 236 | 236 |
| Intellect | 236 | 236 |
| Family | 233 | 233 |
| Wealth | 236 | 236 |
| Environment | 226 | 226 |
| Ummah | 450 | 450 |

### Commit
- `7de6a98` — feat(sources): add Quran/hadith sources to all 1829 subtasks across 7 pillars

### Next steps
- Scholar review pass on the ~1,540 newly generated sources (prior V3.1 review covered only 322 blocks).
- Consider code-splitting seed files (Vite warns >500KB chunks).

## [2026-04-16] feat | Hadith enrichment V3.1 — scholar review pass; expanded blacklists and fiqh gate

### What was done
- Acted as Islamic studies reviewer on all 322 V3 sourced blocks (full read of faith + ummah, sampled wealth/intellect/environment).
- Identified gold-standard citations (e.g., 28:26 Shu'ayb's daughter on hiring, 2:282 ayat al-dayn on debt docs, 4:35 arbitrator on mediation, 107:7 Ma'un on neighbor aid, 9:35 on kanz).
- Flagged 1 critical attribution error: 2:258 (Nimrud debate) cited for Ibrahim's sacrifice (correct: 37:102-107).
- Flagged 1 fiqh leak: 2:235 (iddah marriage-proposal) on wealth/contract subtask — was unguarded.
- Identified systemic pattern: paradise/eschatology verses (55, 56, 76, 88) pulled toward worldly subtasks via concrete-noun matches.
- Extended `FIQH_SENSITIVE_AYAHS` +13 verses with per-ayah keyword gates.
- Extended `AYAH_BLACKLIST` +30 entries, `HADITH_BLACKLIST` +14 entries.
- Re-scored and re-applied: 322 → 287 sourced blocks at higher per-citation quality.
- Review document at `stages/hadith-scholar-review-review.md`.

### Commit
- `ec6d76d` — feat(hadith): v3.1 scholar-reviewed — expanded blacklists, fiqh set, rewrote

## [2026-04-16] feat | Hadith enrichment V3 — semantic reranker (sentence-transformer embeddings) replaces lexical scoring

### What was done
- Replaced `rerank-hadith-candidates.mjs` (lexical) path with new `rerank-hadith-embeddings.mjs` using `Xenova/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` (quantized, 384-dim).
- Added `strip-hadith-sources.mjs` helper for clean re-apply cycles.
- Fixed quoted-key regex bug in `apply-hadith-sources.mjs` that was skipping all 216 moontrance blocks.
- Layered safety filters as post-embedding vetoes:
  - Per-ayah fiqh gate (iddah/divorce/dhihar verses only pass when subtask title contains topical trigger words)
  - Hadith blacklist (12 recurring FPs) + ayah blacklist (20 lexical false-friends)
  - Short-title threshold bump (≤5 words → 0.50, else 0.45)
  - Domain clash filter retained from V2
- Coverage: 1,826 blocks → 322 sourced (17.6%). Per-citation quality ~60% strong (from ~40% V1 baseline).
- QA audits at `stages/hadith-qa-audit-{review,v2-review}.md`; V3 decision at `wiki/decisions/2026-04-16-hadith-semantic-reranker.md`.

### Commit
- `2c36ce6` — feat(hadith): v3 semantic reranker — embeddings + fiqh/blacklist filters

## [2026-04-16] refactor | CeremonyGuard Phase 2d — dynamic guard for ModulePlaceholder + static wrap for Project; refactor initiative CLOSED

- **New component** `src/components/islamic/CeremonyGuardDynamic.jsx` — param-driven sibling that reads `moduleId` from `useParams(paramKey)` (default `'moduleId'`). Keeps the prop-driven `CeremonyGuard` primitive pure (decision Q1 → option b). Same threshold-store subscription + `CeremonyGate` render; DEV-only warn on missing param.
- **App.jsx wiring**: `/app/:moduleId` catch-all wrapped in `<CeremonyGuardDynamic>`; `/app/work/:projectId` wrapped in static `<CeremonyGuard moduleId="work">`. Audit revealed Project gated a hard-coded `"work"` literal — no dynamic resolution needed (decision Q2 → option i: preserve "work" gate, matches Phase 2a option-a contract for embedded tabs). Nested `Outlet`-based children (`people`, `tasks`, `money`, `assets`, `office`, `tech`, `journal`) still render through Project's `<Outlet />` after the gate passes — no per-child wrap needed.
- **Pages stripped**: `ModulePlaceholder.jsx` and `Project.jsx` — removed `useThresholdStore` + `CeremonyGate` imports, subscription, and in-body gate return. Not-found branches and all other logic preserved intact.
- **Dead-code deletion**: `src/pages/ComingSoon.jsx` removed (unimported in live src — only doc references existed). Parallel to `FivePillars.jsx` deletion in Phase 2c-sources. `src/pages/CONTEXT.md` updated.
- **Stretch rejected (decision Q3 → decline)**: Lifting the 3 `SourcesPage` tab gates via a `searchParams`-driven guard is **technically blocked**, not just out of scope. `SourcesPage` holds `activeTab` in local React state set by button `onClick` — clicking a tab does NOT update the URL. A guard above `SourcesPage` reading `searchParams.get('tab')` cannot gate what the user sees. Per-tab in-body pattern is structurally load-bearing AND matches the Phase 2c-sources semantic intent (distinct openings for Quran/Hadith/Knowledge). Permanently retained.
- **Docs**: `src/components/islamic/CONTEXT.md` rewritten — architecture section now documents three modes (route-level static, route-level dynamic, in-body-by-design). `CeremonyGuard.jsx` header comment trimmed to the intentional Sources-tab case. Decision doc `2026-04-16-ceremony-guard-route-level.md` marks Phase 2d complete.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (2530 modules, 2.04s). Preview cleared `bbiz_thr_open` and confirmed:
  - `/app/fake-module-xyz` → CeremonyGate via dynamic guard ("Fake — Module — Xyz" title rendered by PillarHeader above).
  - `/app/work/faith_core` (unopened work) → CeremonyGate.
  - `/app/work/faith_core/money` (after setting `completedOpening.work = ISO`) → Money embedded UI renders with Dashboard/Income/Expenses/Accounts, **no per-module "money" gate** (CRITICAL Phase 2a option-a regression check — passed). Screenshot captured.
  - `/app/fake-module-xyz` (after setting flag) → ModulePlaceholder renders "Module not found" (expected — gate then not-found; matches pre-refactor order).
  - `/app/work/faith_core` (after opening) → ProjectBoard pipeline renders.
- **Refactor initiative CLOSED**. Final state: `CeremonyGuard` wraps all 38+ thin/homogeneous module routes statically; `CeremonyGuardDynamic` wraps the `:moduleId` catch-all. Only remaining in-body gates are the 3 Sources tabs (`QuranPage`, `HadithPage`, `IslamicKnowledgePage`) — intentional, per-tab semantics, not URL-driven.
- **Graphify verification (post-refactor re-run on `src/`)**: `threshold_store` importers dropped from 93 (2026-04-11 baseline) to **13** (~86% reduction). All 13 remaining importers are correct-by-design: 6 ceremony primitives (`CeremonyGate`, `CeremonyGuard`, `CeremonyGuardDynamic`, `IslamicPanel`, `NiyyahAct`, `ThresholdModal`), 2 app-level (`AppShell`, `MobileNav`), 2 dashboard (`Dashboard`, `TodayFocusSection`), and the 3 intentional Sources tabs. No strays. Graph now 921 nodes / 853 edges / 209 communities; `threshold-store` betweenness dropped from 0.133 → ~0 (the module file node itself has degree 0 under path-id resolution; the shortname alias `threshold_store` carries the 13 import edges). `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` + `graph.json` refreshed.

## [2026-04-16] refactor | CeremonyGuard Phase 2c-sources — closed as no-op + FivePillars dead-code deletion

- **Discovery**: the "sources cluster" from the Phase 2a deferral list (`FivePillars`, `HadithPage`, `IslamicKnowledgePage`, `QuranPage`) was mis-grouped. Actual state: only `SourcesPage` is routed at `/app/sources`; `QuranPage`, `HadithPage`, `IslamicKnowledgePage` are **tab content** inside `SourcesPage`, each gating independently as `"quran"`, `"hadith"`, `"islamic-knowledge"`. `FivePillars.jsx` was dead code — not imported anywhere in live src (only its CSS is imported by `OverviewCards.jsx`).
- **Decision: option (B)** — do NOT lift the 3 tab-content gates. Per-tab gating is the intended semantic (distinct openings for Quran/Hadith/Knowledge), not a wiring accident. Lifting would either (A) collapse them into one gate (behavior change) or (C) require a dynamic-moduleId guard reading `searchParams` — same category as the deferred `ModulePlaceholder`/`ComingSoon` dynamic cases, better handled in a single future pass.
- **Cleanup**: deleted `src/pages/islamic/FivePillars.jsx` (unimported). Retained `FivePillars.css` — still used by `OverviewCards.jsx`. Updated `CeremonyGuard.jsx` header comment to list the actual remaining in-body gates (Project, ModulePlaceholder/ComingSoon, and the intentional Sources tab trio).
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (1.64s). No preview check needed — a comment edit + deletion of an unimported file are not browser-observable.
- **Docs**: decision doc updated — Phase 2c-sources marked closed as no-op + cleanup, rationale recorded; remaining deferred scope renamed Phase 2d (dynamic + route-id-mismatch, 3 pages total).

## [2026-04-16] refactor | CeremonyGuard Phase 2b-ummah — lift gating for 4 ummah pages

- **App.jsx**: 4 ummah standalone routes (`/app/family`, `/app/neighbors`, `/app/community`, `/app/collective`) wrapped in `<CeremonyGuard moduleId="...">`. No embedded variants to reconcile — none of the 4 appear as children of other routes.
- **4 page files stripped**: `FamilyPage.jsx`, `Neighbors.jsx`, `Community.jsx`, `CollectivePage.jsx` — removed `useThresholdStore` + `CeremonyGate` imports, `hasCompletedOpening` subscription, and in-body gate return. `useState`, `useAyahBanner`, and `<Office embedded />` (in FamilyPage only) left untouched.
- **Behavior-change accepted**: `useAyahBanner('ummah_*')` previously ran before the gate's early return, so the global ayah banner was populated while the user sat on the CeremonyGate. Post-lift the page doesn't mount while gated, so the banner stays cleared until the user passes the gate. Accepted as a latent-bug fix — banner-for-unopened-module leaked module-specific UI into the gated state.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (2529 modules, 1.55s). Preview: cleared `bbiz_thr_open`, confirmed all 4 ummah routes show CeremonyGate. Set all 4 `completedOpening` flags → confirmed all 4 render their content (Family with Overview/Office tabs + Nikāḥ ayah, Neighbors, Community with Ummah framework, Collective with Khilāfah framework).
- **Docs**: decision doc updated — Phase 2b-ummah marked complete with behavior-change rationale; Phase 2c deferred clusters enumerated (sources 4, dynamic 2, route-id-mismatch 1 — 7 remaining).

## [2026-04-16] refactor | CeremonyGuard Phase 2a — lift gating for 5 business-module pages

- **App.jsx**: 5 standalone routes (`/app/work`, `/app/money`, `/app/people`, `/app/office`, `/app/tech`) wrapped in `<CeremonyGuard moduleId="...">`. Embedded child routes under `/work/:projectId/*` left unwrapped (option a) — parent `Project` route's own "work" in-body gate already covers them; matches pre-refactor behavior where the per-module in-body gate skipped when `embedded === true`.
- **5 page files stripped**: `Work.jsx`, `Money.jsx`, `People.jsx`, `Office.jsx`, `Tech.jsx` — removed `useThresholdStore` + `CeremonyGate` imports, `hasCompletedOpening` subscription, and in-body gate return. `embedded` prop preserved — still governs `<PillarHeader>` rendering. No other hooks/state touched.
- **Embedded-variant decision recorded**: option (a) — standalone-only gating. Zero behavioral change. Two alternatives considered and rejected: (b) gating both locations would require re-confirming a module-specific opening inside every project tab — unwanted friction; (c) retaining the in-body `!embedded` check would leave dead gate code and block import cleanup.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (2529 modules, 1.37s). Preview: cleared `bbiz_thr_open`, confirmed all 5 standalone routes show CeremonyGate ("This module begins with an opening threshold"). Set all 5 `completedOpening` flags → confirmed all 5 render their own content (Work project list, Money dashboard, People tabs, Office chat, Tech overview). Visited `/app/work/ummah_moontrance-land_core/money` → Money renders as embedded tab with no per-module gate (Project's "work" gate satisfies it). Screenshot saved.
- **Docs**: decision doc updated — Phase 2a marked complete with embedded-variant decision; Phase 2b deferred clusters enumerated (ummah 4, sources 4, dynamic 2, route-id-mismatch 1).
- **Remaining thick pages (~11)**: ummah cluster (`FamilyPage`, `Neighbors`, `Community`, `CollectivePage`), sources cluster (`FivePillars`, `HadithPage`, `IslamicKnowledgePage`, `QuranPage`), dynamic (`ModulePlaceholder`, `ComingSoon`), route-id-mismatch (`Project`). Each needs its own audit — deferred.

## [2026-04-16] refactor | CeremonyGuard Phase 1 — route-level gating for 28 thin pages

- **New component** `src/components/islamic/CeremonyGuard.jsx` — thin wrapper that reads `useThresholdStore((s) => !!s.completedOpening[moduleId])` and renders either `<CeremonyGate moduleId />` or `children`. Intentionally prop-driven only (no `useParams`) — dynamic-moduleId cases deferred to Phase 2.
- **App.jsx** imports `CeremonyGuard` and wraps 28 thin routes: faith-shahada/salah/zakah/sawm/hajj, life-physical/mental/safety/social, intellect-learning/thinking/cognitive/professional, family-marriage/parenting/kinship/home, wealth-earning/financial/ownership/circulation, env-resource/waste/ecosystem/sourcing, moontrance-land/seasonal/residency.
- **28 page files simplified** via one-shot refactor script — removed `useThresholdStore` + `CeremonyGate` imports and the 2-line gate check; page bodies reduced to pure content (e.g. `FaithSalahPage` from 9 lines to 5). No behavior change — guard runs the same store subscription and gate UI.
- **Thick pages untouched (~16)** — Work, Money, People, Office, Tech, Project, FamilyPage, Neighbors, Community, CollectivePage, FivePillars, HadithPage, IslamicKnowledgePage, QuranPage, ModulePlaceholder, ComingSoon. These have hooks before gate check, dynamic moduleId, embedded variants, or route-id mismatches (Project gates "work"). Phase 2 will audit case-by-case.
- **Docs**: `src/components/islamic/CONTEXT.md` rewritten to document the two coexisting modes (route-level vs. in-body). Decision doc `wiki/decisions/2026-04-16-ceremony-guard-route-level.md` created. Memory `project_ceremony_guard_refactor.md` updated — Phase 1 done, Phase 2 deferred.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (2529 modules, 1.07s). Preview spot-checks: `/app/faith-salah` shows CeremonyGate when `bbiz_thr_open` empty; shows pillar content after marking complete; `/app/wealth-earning`, `/app/env-resource`, `/app/moontrance-land` all gate via new guard; `/app/money` (thick, unchanged) still gates via in-body logic.

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 2 — universal-layer pillar fallback + 6 pillar entries (Phase 2 closed)

- **Code change**: `getModuleData(id, 'universal')` now mirrors the Phase 0 pause-question pattern — exact `UNIVERSAL_EQUIV[id]` → `UNIVERSAL_EQUIV[getPillarForModule(id).id]` → `null`. Previously returned `null` for any sub-module not explicitly keyed (i.e., all of them).
- **6 new pillar entries in `UNIVERSAL_EQUIV`** — full `work`-shape secular-ethics content, zero Islamic terminology:
  - `faith` — Integrity / Meaning — values-coherence + purpose-direction framing
  - `life` — Sustainability / Rest — capacity-pace + recovery-release framing
  - `intellect` — Rigor / Humility — evidence-reasoning + openness-correction framing
  - `wealth` — Stewardship / Sufficiency — deliberate-use + enough-contentment framing (distinct from legacy `money` entry which remains untouched)
  - `environment` — Trusteeship / Foresight — care-for-place + long-horizon framing
  - `ummah` — Presence / Contribution — attention-to-others + what-I-add framing
- Each entry: `principles[2]`, `mindfulness` + `resumeMindfulness` + `closingMindfulness`, `readiness` (frame + 2 labels + 6 rows with `{id, attr, attrTitle?, attrFrame?, yesLabel?, notYetLabel?, governing, notYet}` + `governing[6]` + `notYet[6]`), `reflection` (frame + 2 labels + `governing[2]` + `notYet[2]`).
- **Family anomaly (option a)** — pre-existing `UNIVERSAL_EQUIV.family` carried Islamic-style content (Al-Wadud/Al-Qayyum attrs + Arabic dua from Al-Furqan 25:74 + closingDua from Al-Ahqaf 46:15 + flat 3-string readiness) in the universal layer — inconsistent with the layer's opt-out-of-Islamic-framing purpose. Reshaped to secular `work`-shape pattern with user approval this session: principles Presence/Mercy, full mindfulness strings, 6-row readiness, full reflection. Islamic Family content preserved in `MODULE_ATTRS.family` (commit `fd8a0e8`, Phase 1 Family).
- Verification: `npm run build` passes (2528 modules, 1.08s); preview eval of `getModuleData(id, 'universal')` for 12 sample ids confirmed — 6 pillar sub-module samples (`faith-salah`, `life-physical`, `intellect-learning`, `wealth-earning`, `env-resource`, `moontrance-land`) each fall back to correct pillar entry with 6 rows, mindfulness strings present, zero Arabic/Islamic terms; 5 legacy entries (`work`, `money`, `people`, `office`, `tech`) resolve directly without fallback; `family-marriage` correctly falls back to reshaped secular `family` pillar.
- **Phase 2 closed.** Decision doc `wiki/decisions/2026-04-16-threshold-content-phased-fix.md` updated — Phase 2 marked complete, family-anomaly option (a) recorded.

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Ummah — Islamic content for 5 Ummah sub-modules (Phase 1 closed)

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for `neighbors` (Al-Wadūd/Al-Muḥsin), `community` (Al-Jāmiʿ/Al-Walī — Al-Walī axis to avoid pillar duplication), `moontrance-land` (Al-Khāliq/Al-Bāriʾ), `moontrance-seasonal` (Al-Mudabbir/Al-Fattāḥ), `moontrance-residency` (Al-Walī/Al-Ḥafīẓ). Asma ul-Husna pairings match `src/data/modules.js:100-128, 496-542`.
- Each block carries unique `dua` + `closingDua` + 5 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows. Sources: An-Nisāʾ 4:36 / Bukhari 6014–Muslim 2624 (neighbors), Āl ʿImrān 3:103 / Al-Ḥujurāt 49:10 (community), Al-Baqarah 2:30 / Al-Aʿrāf 7:56 (moontrance-land), Al-Anʿām 6:99 / Bukhari 2320 sadaqah-jāriyah hadith (moontrance-seasonal), Al-Ḥashr 59:9 Ansar verse / Ash-Shūrā 42:38 (moontrance-residency). No source duplication with pillar (Al-Hashr 59:10) or pre-existing `collective` block (An-Naml 27:19 / Al-Mulk 67:15).
- **Scope correction during session**: initial brief listed 6 sub-modules, but `collective` was already authored pre-Phase 1 (legacy block at line 535, Al-Khāliq/Ar-Razzāq — MTC umbrella). Scope reduced to 5 new blocks; existing `collective` block left untouched.
- **PAUSE_QUESTIONS.ummah** + **PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.ummah** added — all six `ummah.subModuleIds` inherit via Phase 0's pillar fallback.
- Pillar-level `ummah` block (Al-Raḥīm/Al-Jāmiʿ, Al-Hashr 59:10 — recovered from Phase 0 people→ummah rename) left untouched.
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; preview eval of `getModuleData` confirmed all 5 blocks load with distinct attrs/dua/closing sources, 5 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows each; `getPauseQuestion('moontrance-land')` and `getPauseQuestionUniversal('neighbors')` return the new ummah pillar-level fallback correctly.
- **Phase 1 closed.** All seven pillars now carry per-sub-module Islamic-layer content or legitimate pillar fallback. Decision doc `wiki/decisions/2026-04-16-threshold-content-phased-fix.md` updated to mark Ummah ✓ and declare Phase 1 complete.
- Progress: Family ✓ · Faith ✓ · Life ✓ · Intellect ✓ · Wealth ✓ · Environment ✓ · **Ummah ✓ — Phase 1 complete.** Phase 2 (universal layer mirror) now open.

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Environment — Islamic content for 4 Environment sub-modules

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for `env-resource` (Al-Muḥyī/Al-Badīʿ), `env-waste` (Al-Quddūs/Aṭ-Ṭāhir), `env-ecosystem` (Al-Ḥafīẓ/Ar-Raqīb), `env-sourcing` (Al-ʿAlīm/Ar-Rashīd). Asma ul-Husna pairings match `src/data/modules.js:433-475`.
- Each block carries unique `dua` + `closingDua` + 5 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows. Sources: Al-Anbiya 21:30 / Al-Araf 7:31 (resource), Al-Baqarah 2:222 / Ar-Rum 30:41 (waste), Al-Anam 6:165 / Musnad Ahmad 12902 sapling hadith (ecosystem), Al-Baqarah 2:172 / Al-Baqarah 2:188 (sourcing).
- **PAUSE_QUESTIONS.environment** + **PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.environment** added — all four `env-*` sub-modules inherit via Phase 0's pillar fallback.
- Pillar-level `environment` block (Al-Wakīl) left untouched.
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; `getModuleData` confirmed via preview eval — all 4 blocks load with distinct attrs/dua/closing sources; `getPauseQuestion('env-resource')` and `getPauseQuestionUniversal('env-waste')` both return the new pillar-level fallback correctly.
- Commit: `1372038`
- Progress: Phase 1 pillar order → Family ✓ · Faith ✓ · Life ✓ · Intellect ✓ · Wealth ✓ · **Environment ✓** · Ummah (Ummah carries valid content from Phase 0 people→ummah rename; Phase 1 Islamic layer now complete pending Ummah review).

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Wealth — Islamic content for 4 Wealth sub-modules

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for `wealth-earning` (Ar-Razzāq/Al-Fattāḥ), `wealth-financial` (Ar-Razzāq/Al-Ghanī), `wealth-ownership` (Al-ʿAdl/Al-Muqsiṭ), `wealth-circulation` (Al-Karīm/Al-Wahhāb). Asma ul-Husna pairings match `src/data/modules.js:387-429`.
- Each block carries unique `dua` + `closingDua` + 5 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows. Sources: Tirmidhi 3563 / Hud 11:6 (earning), Musnad Ahmad variant / Fatir 35:15 (financial), An-Nahl 16:90 / An-Nisa 4:135 (ownership), Ali Imran 3:92 / Al-Baqarah 2:261 (circulation).

- Pillar-level `wealth` block (Al-Razzāq/Al-Ḥasīb) left untouched.
- Scope note: the wealth pillar's `subModuleIds` also includes 5 legacy feature modules (`work`, `money`, `people`, `office`, `tech`) which already carry their own `MODULE_ATTRS` blocks from the top of the file. Session scope was explicitly limited to the four Maqasid `wealth-*` sub-modules per plan.
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; `getModuleData` confirmed via preview eval — all 4 blocks load with distinct attrs/dua/closing sources; `getPauseQuestion('wealth-earning')` and `getPauseQuestionUniversal('wealth-financial')` both return the new pillar-level fallback correctly.
- Commit: `887f944`
- Progress: Phase 1 pillar order → Family ✓ · Faith ✓ · Life ✓ · Intellect ✓ · **Wealth ✓** · Environment · Ummah (Ummah carries valid content from Phase 0).

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Intellect — Islamic content for 4 Intellect sub-modules

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for `intellect-learning` (Al-ʿAlīm/Al-Khabīr), `intellect-thinking` (Al-Ḥakīm/Al-Baṣīr), `intellect-cognitive` (Al-Muhaymin/Al-Ḥafīẓ — shared with `life-safety` but distinct framing toward attention-stewardship), `intellect-professional` (Al-Muṣawwir/Al-Bāriʾ). Asma ul-Husna pairings match `src/data/modules.js:286-328`.
- Each block carries unique `dua` + `closingDua` + 5 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows. Sources: Ta-Ha 20:114 / Ibn Majah 251 (learning), Ash-Shuʿara 26:83 / traditional ḥaqq-bāṭil duʿāʾ (thinking), Ta-Ha 20:25–26 / Sahih Muslim 2722 (cognitive), traditional yassir duʿāʾ / Muʿjam al-Awsaṭ 897 itqān hadith (professional).

- Pillar-level `intellect` block (Al-Fattāḥ/Al-ʿAlīm) left untouched.
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; `getModuleData` confirmed via preview eval — all 4 blocks load with distinct attrs/dua/closing sources; `getPauseQuestion('intellect-learning')` and `getPauseQuestionUniversal('intellect-thinking')` both return the new pillar-level fallback correctly.
- Commit: `6979374`
- Progress: Phase 1 pillar order → Family ✓ · Faith ✓ · Life ✓ · **Intellect ✓** · Wealth · Environment · Ummah (Ummah carries valid content from Phase 0).

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Life — Islamic content for 4 Life sub-modules

- **PAUSE_QUESTIONS.life** + **PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.life** added — all four `life-*` sub-modules inherit via Phase 0's pillar fallback.
- Pillar-level `life` block (Al-Qawī/Al-Laṭīf) left untouched.
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; `getModuleData` confirmed via preview eval — all 4 blocks load with distinct attrs/dua/closing sources; `getPauseQuestion('life-physical')` and `getPauseQuestionUniversal('life-mental')` both return the new pillar-level fallback correctly. Screenshot tool was unresponsive during this session — visual ceremony verification skipped, data-layer checks substituted.
- Commit: `443e02c`
- Progress: Phase 1 pillar order → Family ✓ · Faith ✓ · **Life ✓** · Intellect · Wealth · Environment · Ummah (Ummah carries valid content from Phase 0 people→ummah rename).

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Faith — Islamic content for 9 Faith sub-modules

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for the five pillars of Islam, the Sources module, and the three board tiers (`faith-shahada` Al-Ahad/As-Samad, `faith-salah` Al-Qarib/Al-Mujib, `faith-zakah` Ar-Razzaq/Al-Karim, `faith-sawm` As-Sabur/Ash-Shakur, `faith-hajj` Al-Malik/Al-Quddus, `sources` Al-Hadi/Al-Alim, `faith-core` Al-Muhyi/Al-Qayyum for Daruriyyat, `faith-growth` Ar-Rafi/Al-Fattah for Hajiyyat, `faith-excellence` Al-Muhsin/Al-Jamil for Tahsiniyyat)
- Each block carries unique `dua` + `closingDua` + 3–4 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows; Asma ul-Husna pairings match `src/data/modules.js` attrs strings
- **`faith-core`/`faith-growth`/`faith-excellence`** carry tier-specific (Daruriyyat/Hajiyyat/Tahsiniyyat) framing rather than pillar fallback — resolves the open call from `wiki/decisions/2026-04-16-threshold-content-phased-fix.md`
- **PAUSE_QUESTIONS.faith** + **PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.faith** added — all six `faith-*` sub-modules inside `faith.subModuleIds` inherit via Phase 0's pillar fallback
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; `getModuleData` confirms all 9 blocks load with distinct attrs/dua/closing sources; `getPauseQuestion('faith-salah')` correctly falls back to the pillar question
- Pillar-level `faith` block (Al-Mutakabbir/Al-Wakil) already existed and was left untouched
- Commit: `e72ebc5`

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Family — Islamic content for pillar + 5 sub-modules

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for `family` (Al-Wadud/Ar-Rahman), `family-marriage` (Al-Wadud/As-Salam), `family-parenting` (Ar-Rabb/Al-Hafiz), `family-kinship` (Al-Wakil/Ash-Shakur), `family-home` (As-Salam/Al-Quddus), `family-office` (Al-Jami/Al-Hafiz)
- Each block: unique dua (Ar-Rum 30:21, Ibrahim 14:40, An-Nisa 4:1, Al-Muminun 23:29, Ali Imran 3:8), closingDua, 4–5 readiness rows, 2 reflection rows with governing/notYet pairs
- **PAUSE_QUESTIONS.family** + **PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.family** added — all five sub-modules inherit the pillar-level pause question via Phase 0's fallback
- Verification: build passes; `family-marriage` ceremony renders Ar-Rum 30:21 dua and Al-Wadud/As-Salam attrs panel correctly in preview DOM
- Commit: `fd8a0e8`

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 0 — Threshold popup code-path fixes

- **Pause-question pillar fallback**: added `getPauseQuestion` / `getPauseQuestionUniversal` helpers in `src/data/islamic/islamic-data.js` that try module id → pillar id → `work` default. Wired into `DEFER_CONTENT.getGuidanceQuestion`, `DEFER_UNIVERSAL.getGuidanceQuestion`, and `ThresholdModal.jsx:222-224`. Replaces silent `PAUSE_QUESTIONS[id] || PAUSE_QUESTIONS.work` default that hit 36 of 42 modules.
- **`people` triple-key collision fixed**: renamed the line 1105 `MODULE_ATTRS.people` block (Al-Raḥīm · Al-Jāmiʿ, Surah Al-Hashr 59:10) to `ummah`, reviving the shadowed line 230 `people` module-level block (Al-Wadud · Al-Adl) and filling the Ummah pillar gap for free.
- **Orphan `crm` content deleted**: removed `MODULE_ATTRS.crm`, `UNIVERSAL_EQUIV.crm`, and `PAUSE_QUESTIONS.crm` / `PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.crm` entries. CRM lives under People → Sales Pipeline tab; standalone module was unrouted.
- **Unrouted dead code deleted**: `src/pages/modules/CRM.jsx` + `CRM.css`.
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; lint clean on touched files; browser smoke test confirmed People module shows module-level Dua and Ummah pillar renders renamed content.
- Decision recorded: `wiki/decisions/2026-04-16-threshold-content-phased-fix.md`. Phase 1 (Islamic content pillar-by-pillar, starting with Family) and Phase 2 (universal layer) still to come.

## [2026-04-16] feat | Expand wealth + environment subtask descriptions with Why/How format

- **Wealth seed file** (`src/data/seed-tasks/wealth-seed-tasks.js`): added `description` template literals to all **236 subtasks** across 4 submodules (Earning & Provision, Financial Literacy & Management, Ownership & Rights, Circulation & Impact) × 3 boards (core, growth, excellence)
- **Environment seed file** (`src/data/seed-tasks/environment-seed-tasks.js`): added `description` template literals to all **226 subtasks** across 4 submodules (Resource Consumption, Waste & Pollution, Ecosystem & Biodiversity, Ethical Sourcing & Circularity) × 3 boards
- **Total: 462 subtask descriptions** added, completing 6 of 7 Maqasid pillars (Faith, Life, Intellect, Family, Wealth, Environment). Ummah remains.
- All descriptions follow the **Why does this matter? / How do I accomplish this?** format with Islamic grounding (Quranic references, hadith, fiqhi principles) and practical actionable steps
- Files grew from ~600 lines each to ~12,000+ lines. Build passes cleanly.

## [2026-04-16] feat | Source(s) button + subtask content system for TaskDetailPanel

- **Source(s) button** added to all subtask footers (always visible, globally standard across all modules)
- **Sources slide-in view** — clicking opens a 4th panel view rendering `activeSubtask.sources` as markdown with blue underlined links opening in new tabs; empty state shown when no sources yet
- **`sources` field** added to subtask data model — propagated by `seedTasks` and backfilled by `backfillSeedDescriptions` in `project-store.js`
- **Backfill upgraded** — now syncs description whenever seed differs from stored (not just when longer), enabling intentional content updates
- **Rich descriptions populated** for 5 faith/shahada subtasks using the `subtask-content` skill: Recite the full Shahada, Study the linguistic meaning, Learn what negation/affirmation entail, Understand worship without partners, Review Quranic ayat on Tawhid
- **Sources data** added to 3 of those subtasks (Understand worship, Review Quranic ayat, Study linguistic meaning)
- **Subtask hint text** updated: "(tap each one for more info)" → "(tap each one to see why and how)"
- **Task title** made globally read-only in TaskDetailPanel (readOnly attribute + CSS pointer-events: none)
- **Ayah banner** corrected: "no god but God" → "no god but Allah" in Quran 47:19 translation

## [2026-04-15] fix | Rename "Task Document" button to "Resources" in TaskDetailPanel footer

## [2026-04-15] feat | Dashboard pipeline stage cards deep-link to correct stage
- Each `.bfd__pipeline-stage` card on the Dashboard now navigates to its specific BBOS stage.
- Implementation: React Router `location.state.stage` (not URL search params — `useSearchParams()` returned empty in the router context; location state is immune to Strict Mode remounting).
- `Dashboard.jsx`: added `state={{ stage: stageId }}` to each stage Link.
- `ProjectBoard.jsx`: added `useLocation`, initializes `bbosFilter` from `location.state?.stage`.

## [2026-04-15] fix | TodayFocusSection light-mode contrast fixes
- **Card name contrast**: `.tfs-card__name` was hardcoded `#e4e8f4` (near-white), invisible on the light-tinted card background. Changed to `var(--text)`.
- **Arabic subtitle opacity**: Inline style changed from `accentColor + '80'` (50% opacity) to full `accentColor` — legible on light surface.
- **CTA card dark-mode bleed**: All hardcoded dark hex values in `.tfs-cta` block replaced with CSS variables (`--bg3/4`, `--border/2`, `--text2/3`).
- **CTA interactivity**: Converted outer `<div class="tfs-cta">` to `<button>` (full-card click target). Removed inner "Set focus →" button element entirely.

## [2026-04-15] fix | Permanent mobile nav bottom-blocking fix + task modal features
- **Mobile nav architecture fix**: Removed `position: fixed` from MobileNav, placed in CSS grid flow (`grid-row: 3`). Eliminates recurring bug where bottom content was obscured (~20 prior fix attempts). Added `--mobile-nav-h` token. Cleaned up padding-bottom hacks in DashboardView, PillarBoard, Sidebar.
- **Task Document slide-in**: Wired "Task Document" footer button in TaskDetailPanel to open secondary panel with status, priority, assignee, due date, tags fields. Keyed remount animation for slide transitions.
- **BBOS form validation**: Done button in BbosTaskPanel now validates all required fields, shows red banner + inline error highlighting + shake animation when empty.
- **Save for Later button**: Added to BbosTaskPanel footer — saves current field data and closes without validation.
- **Gate indicator links**: Made BBOS gate diamonds (◆) in LevelNavigator clickable — navigates to stage and scrolls to Stage Health Score section.
- **Removed segment percentage labels**: Removed `fln__segment-pct` from LevelNavigator per user request.
- **Mobile responsive pass**: Both TaskDetailPanel and BbosTaskPanel go full-screen on mobile with adjusted spacing.
- **AppShell TDZ fix**: Moved `useLocation()` declaration before its usage in useEffect to fix temporal dead zone crash.

- Files modified (20): tokens.css, AppShell.jsx, Sidebar.jsx, TopBar.jsx, MobileNav.jsx, NotificationsPanel.jsx, ThresholdModal.jsx, PrayerOverlay.jsx, PrayerOverlay.css, ResumeOverlay.jsx, TaskDetailPanel.jsx, SearchPalette.jsx, LevelNavigator.jsx, IslamicTerm.css, ChartTooltip.jsx, ActivityChart.jsx, MoneyDashboard.jsx, Dashboard.jsx, PillarLevelDashboard.jsx, ExpensePanel.jsx, BbosTaskPanel.jsx, CompanyNotesTab.jsx, SkillsTab.jsx, CategoryPanel.jsx

## [2026-04-15] implement | People Module Stabilization (System Report §11.6)
- Audit confirmed module is stable — not mid-refactor as report suggested. 42 .jsx files, 3 stores, 6 sub-directories all functional.
- **CompanyNotesTab:** Wired to contacts-store — notes now persist via `updateCompany(companyId, { notes })`. Was local-only state.

- Files modified: BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.css, bbos-pipeline.js, ProjectBoard.jsx, LevelNavigator.jsx, LevelNavigator.css, bbos/CONTEXT.md

## [2026-04-15] reskin | Task Modal + BBOS Panel + Factory Tabs
- **Task Detail Modal:** Full CSS rewrite of TaskDetailPanel (672px, 24px radius, `--tdp-accent` theming, circular subtask checkboxes, progress bar, spacious layout). JSX restructured: priority badge, read-only description, single "Task Document" footer button. Removed secondary controls from render.
- **BBOS Task Panel:** CSS rewrite of BbosTaskPanel to match new design language. JSX restructured: badges row (stage + status inline select), meta row (assignee + governing attributes), purpose section, bento grid (dependencies + template cards), rationale accordion, form fields, G-Label, notes container, validation flags, AI draft section, discard-with-confirmation footer.
- **Accent color wiring:** `accentColor` prop threaded from PillarLevelPage/ProjectBoard → TaskDetailPanel → BbosTaskPanel. Level colors: core=#C8A96E, growth=#4ab8a8, excellence=#8b5cf6.

- Files modified: TaskDetailPanel.jsx/css, BbosTaskPanel.jsx/css, BbosFullDashboard.jsx/css, PillarLevelPage.jsx, ProjectBoard.jsx
- Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-task-modal-reskin-design.md`

## [2026-04-15] implement | Chart Tooltips — Shared ChartTooltip component + 8 chart wiring
- **Design:** Brainstormed with visual companion mockups, produced spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-chart-tooltips-design.md`
- **Shared component:** Created `src/components/shared/ChartTooltip.jsx` + `.css` — portal-rendered tooltip via `createPortal(el, document.body)`, same pattern as IslamicTerm glossary tooltips
- **Two anchor modes:** `above` (bar/ring/gauge — centered above target, flips below if < 180px headroom) and `crosshair` (line charts — vertical dashed line + floating tooltip, enlarges hovered circle)
- **8 charts wired:**
  1. Money bar chart (MoneyDashboard.jsx) — month, expenses, discretionary, over-budget
  2. BCG line chart (Dashboard.jsx) — crosshair, task count + day label
  3. Activity chart (ActivityChart.jsx) — crosshair, task count + day label
  4. Savings donut (MoneyDashboard.jsx) — % saved, saved/spent amounts
  5. Mastery ring (PillarLevelDashboard.jsx) — % complete, tasks done/total
  6. Workflow pressure (Dashboard.jsx) — level, filled/10, in-progress count
  7. Spending limit bar (MoneyDashboard.jsx) — amount/budget, % over
  8. Cost analysis rows (MoneyDashboard.jsx) — category, %, dollar amount
- **Interaction:** Desktop hover (150ms fade), mobile tap-to-toggle with outside-tap dismiss

## [2026-04-15] audit+implement | UI/UX Audit — Border/Shadow + Typography Scale Consolidation (Dimensions 4 & 5 continued)
- Continuation of April 14 UI/UX audit; scoped to border+shadow redundancy and typography scale consolidation
- **Phase 1 — New tokens defined in tokens.css:**
  - Typography: added `--text-2xs` (0.7rem), `--text-sm-plus` (0.8rem) to fill gaps in 8-step UI scale
  - Display scale: added `--text-2xl` through `--text-7xl` (1.75rem–3.75rem) for hero/page-level headings
  - Shadows: added `--shadow-card`, `--shadow-card-hover`, `--shadow-accent`, `--shadow-glow-green`, `--shadow-glow-amber`, `--shadow-glow-red`, `--shadow-glow-cyan`
  - Dark theme overrides added for all new shadow tokens
- **Phase 2 — Shadow consolidation (37 hardcoded box-shadow + 7 hardcoded border colors):**
  - Replaced dashboard card shadows (DashboardTaskCard, BbosFullDashboard, PillarLevelDashboard) → `--shadow-card` / `--shadow-card-hover`
  - Replaced audit CTA button shadows across 7 pillar dashboards + QuranPage + HadithPage → `--shadow-xs` / `--shadow-lg`
  - Replaced glow shadows in TechOverview + HealthPulse → `--shadow-glow-*` tokens
  - Replaced accent shadows in ThresholdModal + ResumeOverlay → `--shadow-accent`
  - Replaced panel shadows in TaskDetailPanel + BbosTaskPanel → `--shadow-lg`
  - Replaced hardcoded border colors in BbosFullDashboard, PillarBoard, TechOverview, WealthDashboard → semantic tokens
  - Office focus rings (Announcements, DocumentManager, Forum) → `--col-progress-bg`
- **Phase 3 — Typography scale consolidation (580+ hardcoded font-size declarations):**
  - Mapped all font-size values to nearest token: 0.5–0.65rem → `--text-xs`, 0.66–0.72rem → `--text-2xs`, 0.73–0.77rem → `--text-sm`, 0.78–0.84rem → `--text-sm-plus`, 0.85–0.93rem → `--text-base`, 0.94–1.06rem → `--text-md`, 1.07–1.19rem → `--text-lg`, 1.2–1.5rem → `--text-xl`, 1.6+ → display tokens
  - Converted pixel font-sizes (9px–18px) to rem token equivalents
  - Sub-0.65rem values raised to `--text-xs` (enforcing P1 floor from prior audit)
  - Result: 0 hardcoded font-size values remain in CSS (excluding 2 clamp() responsive declarations)
- **Before:** 5.8% token adoption (36/618 font-size declarations), 37 hardcoded shadows
- **After:** 100% token adoption for font-size, 100% for box-shadow, 100% for border colors
- Build verified clean; preview spot-checked on Money, Dashboard, Faith pillar — no regressions
- Files modified: tokens.css + ~50 CSS files across src/components/ and src/pages/

## [2026-04-15] implement | Money Dashboard chart — expense-based segments + isEssential categories
- **Balance Overview chart restructure:**
  - Bar height now based on `expenses` (was `income`); no surplus/income spacer
  - 3 segments (bottom → top): Expenses (dark green) · Discretionary Spending (light green = budget headroom) · Over Budget (purple hatched)
  - Discretionary Spending = `max(0, budgetTarget − expenses)` — bars reach exactly to Max Target line when under budget
  - All 4 corners rounded per segment (`border-radius: 4px`); stack background removed
  - Ceiling = `niceMax(max(expenses, budgetTarget))` across all months
- **`isEssential` flag on preset categories:**
  - Added to `PRESET_CATEGORIES` in `money-categories.js`
  - Essential: Rent, Utility, Utility Bills, Transport, Payroll; all others `false`
  - `chartData` carries `essential`/`discretionary` per month (chart renders all expenses as one block for now)
- Files: MoneyDashboard.jsx, MoneyDashboard.css, money-categories.js, wiki/entities/money-dashboard.md

## [2026-04-15] implement | Hadith sourcing audit + segment nav wrapping + money chart redesign
- **Hadith audit:** scanned entire codebase for non-Sahih hadith references; found 3 issues
  - NiyyahAct.jsx: Tirmidhi 3391 → Sahih Muslim 2723 (morning/evening duas), added time-of-day logic via `getDua()` selector
  - islamic-data.js LIFE module closing dua: Tirmidhi 3401 → Quran 26:78–80 (Ibrahim AS on creation, sustenance, healing)
  - quran-overview.js HIFZ virtues: Abu Dawud claims → Sahih Muslim 804 & 798 (Quran intercession, reciters' reward)
  - All 40+ Quranic ayat already sourced to Quran; all other module duas already Quran/Sahih
- **LevelNavigator segment nav wrapping:** segment buttons ("EARNING & PROVISION", etc.) overlapping on small screens
  - Root cause: `.fln__segment-nav` had `white-space: nowrap` with no width constraint
  - Fix: `white-space: normal` + `max-width: 100%` allows wrapping into 2 lines on narrow viewports
  - Tested: 600px → labels wrap cleanly; 1280px → single line preserved
- **Money Dashboard chart redesign:** relabel and recolor for clarity
  - Legend changed: "Income" → "Expenses", "Expenses" → "Discretionary Spending"
  - Color change: expense bar from yellow (#fde68a) → light mint (#86efac) for visual distinction from income green (#22c55e)
  - Bar order reordered: over-budget now appears above expenses (visually correct priority)
  - Data binding fixed: bar height still driven by `d.income`; dark green background shows savings gap; light green = `withinExpenses` (budgeted portion); purple = `overBudget` spike
- Files: NiyyahAct.jsx, islamic-data.js, quran-overview.js, LevelNavigator.css, MoneyDashboard.jsx, MoneyDashboard.css
- Commit: 6f0c72d

## [2026-04-14] implement | Money Dashboard — Balance overview chart redesign
- Replaced weekly side-by-side bar chart with monthly stacked bar chart (9 months)
- Chart logic: bar height = monthly income; expenses (yellow) from bottom; transparent spacer holds savings gap; income background shows through
- Added Y-axis labels, horizontal gridlines, dashed budget target line ("Max Target Spending"), over-budget purple hatched segment
- Legend repositioned below chart; Income · Expenses · Over budget
- Fixed double-counting bug (previously stacked savings + income + expenses additively)
- Fixed flex sizing bug (transparent spacer required so expense segment doesn't stretch to fill full bar)
- New wiki entity: `wiki/entities/money-dashboard.md`

## [2026-04-14] implement | Font family tokenization — codebase-wide
- Extended font token system introduced in the P0 session to all remaining files (50+ files)
- New tokens added: `--font-display` (Manrope + DM Sans fallback), `--font-serif` (Noto Serif)
- Full token set: `--font-body`, `--font-heading`, `--font-display`, `--font-serif`, `--font-arabic`, `--font-mono`
- CSS files updated: all 6 pillar dashboards, UmmahDashboard, FaithLevelNavigator, LevelOverviewPage/FaithLevelOverview SVG ring text, FivePillars, QuranPage/HadithPage/IslamicKnowledgePage/SourcesPage, landing.css, BbosFullDashboard/BbosTaskPanel, PillarLevelDashboard, PillarBoard, InlineTaskDetail, TaskDetailPanel, MoneyDashboard, ExpenseList, Sidebar, TopBar, DashboardTaskCard, SearchPalette, IslamicPanel, AyahBanner, PrayerTime, PrayerOverlay, ReadinessCheck, DuaSection, AttributeCard, NiyyahAct, PillarCard, ModuleHealthCard, DealPipeline, HRPage, IslamicTerm, ReferenceList, ThresholdModal, AttendanceView, DocumentManager, LevelNavigator, global.css
- JSX/inline styles updated: ProjectBoard, KanbanCard, GLabelPicker, GLabelBadge, ActivityChart (mono + body SVG attrs), Dashboard (BCG SVG), Work, TimeTracker, StatsTab, Settings (4 instances), InvoiceList, BbosRoleBadge, IncomeTab
- Build verified: `npm run build` clean (0 errors, 2256 modules, 907ms)

## [2026-04-14] audit+implement | UI/UX Audit — Dashboard Design & Typography (Dimensions 4 & 5)
- Audited Dashboard against NotebookLM notebook "Modern UI/UX Design: From Bland to Bespoke Masterpiece" (ID 279ecab6, 10 YouTube sources)
- Scope: Dimension 4 (Dashboard-Specific Design) and Dimension 5 (Typography & Content)
- Scorecard: 2 Pass, 3 Fail, 5 Partial Pass, 1 Warn across 11 criteria
- **P0 remediations implemented:**
  - Empty States Overhaul — 4 section empty states upgraded from plain text to icon + human text + CTA pattern (BCG, Open Tasks, Upcoming, Activity)
  - Font Family Consolidation — added `--font-body`, `--font-heading`, `--font-arabic`, `--font-mono` tokens to tokens.css; replaced hardcoded Space Grotesk and Amiri refs in Dashboard.css with token vars; replaced inline DM Sans in BCG SVG
  - BCG Chart Fixes — renamed to "Barakah Consistency", wired range selector (7d/14d/30d) to actually filter data via `.slice(-rangeDays)`, simplified misleading dual-signal legend to "Tasks completed per day", expanded data from 14→30 days
- **P1 remediations implemented:**
  - Font Size Floor — raised all sub-10px sizes (0.58rem, 0.6rem, 0.62rem) to 0.65rem minimum (7 replacements)
  - Task List Enhancement — removed `projects.slice(0, 4)` cap, added horizontal scroll for project tabs, added due date + overdue highlighting, added "View all N tasks" link with hidden count
  - Empty State Text Rewrite — rewrote in human guiding tone ("All clear — create a task to get started", etc.)
- Verified in browser: light mode, dark mode, empty states, BCG range switching all confirmed working
- P2 items deferred: dashboard hierarchy reorder, letter-spacing standardization, task sort/search
- Files: Dashboard.jsx, Dashboard.css, tokens.css, useDashboard.js
- Audit plan: `.claude/plans/elegant-baking-umbrella.md`

## [2026-04-14] implement | Task clicks → popup modal on pillar level pages
- Removed `inlinePanel` from ProjectBoard in PillarLevelPage — DashboardTaskCard clicks now open TaskDetailPanel portal modal instead of InlineTaskDetail inline
- Added `onSubsegClick` to LevelNavigator in PillarLevelPage — subseg (task progress bar segment) clicks now open TaskDetailPanel modal instead of navigating to `?task=` URL
- State: `subsegTask { taskId, project }` held in PillarLevelPage; project resolved via `getProject(${boardPrefix}_${pillarId}_${activeLevel})`
- Verified in preview: card click opens modal, subseg click opens modal for correct task ("Testify there is no God but Allah")
- Files: PillarLevelPage.jsx

## [2026-04-14] website | MILOS microsite and landing page update
- Created `website/maqasid/index.html` — product landing page with hero (59:18), purpose, threshold, solution, seven-pillar grid, CTA
- Created `website/maqasid/journey/index.html` — journey detail page with spine, now-marker at 18%, 4 phases, 8 milestones (6 done)
- Updated `website/index.html` — four-product grid, hero text, triptych, MILOS product card with diamond badge
- Added MILOS nav link across all 10 existing product pages (BBOS, OLOS, MTC and their subpages)
- Added "Full journey →" link to MILOS row on ecosystem journey page
- Pushed to both onaxyzogden/Maqasid and onaxyzogden/ogden-hub
- Files: website/maqasid/{index,journey/index}.html, website/index.html, 10 nav updates, website/journey/index.html

## [2026-04-14] website | Add MILOS to ecosystem journey page
- Fourth product row on `/journey/` — Development (Al-Musawwir) → Completion (Al-Muhsi) → Opening (Al-Fattah) → Ummah (Al-Wasi')
- Phase 1 at 70%: 6/8 milestones done (seven pillar modules, dashboard, BBOS integration, Islamic UI, audit, pillar viz)
- CSS: `--mq-*` color vars, `.mq` phase/milestone selectors following existing pattern
- Header updated: "Four products. Four journeys. One intention."
- Footer: fourth column with MILOS summary
- Also synced milestone counts on BBOS (+Operator Practice Companion), MTC (+stewardship model, +first founding member), fixed OLOS footer 85→86%, date March→April
- Pushed to both onaxyzogden/Maqasid and onaxyzogden/ogden-hub
- Files: website/journey/index.html

## [2026-04-14] implement | BBOS pipeline overview panel — all 9 stages with completion %
- New `PipelineOverview` internal component in `BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — renders between stage header and task grid
- Shows all 9 stages grouped by 3 layers (Think/Execute/Reckon) with colored layer labels
- Each stage card: number (01-09), label, 3px progress bar (colored per stage), completion %
- Active stage highlighted with accent border and tinted background; labels truncate with ellipsis
- `allStageProgress` useMemo computed via single taskMap pass (O(T + D)) — returns `{ FND: 0, TRU: 45, ... }`
- Clickable stage navigation: `onStageSelect(stageId)` callback threaded ProjectBoard → DashboardView → BbosFullDashboard
- `handleStageSelect` in ProjectBoard calls `setBbosFilter + setActiveBbosStage` (same as LevelNavigator segment click)
- Responsive: layers stack vertically on screens < 768px
- Files: BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.css, DashboardView.jsx, ProjectBoard.jsx

## [2026-04-14] implement | BBOS stage complete gate — callout + advance action
- When `stagePct === 100`, a green "Stage complete" callout appears in the stage header (below the progress strip)
- Callout shows: CheckCircle icon + "Stage complete — N/N tasks done" + "Advance to [Next Stage Label] →" button
- At OPT (last stage): button shows "Complete Cycle →" and triggers `startNewBbosCycle` with a confirm dialog
- Advance handler defined in `ProjectBoard.jsx`: calls `advanceBbosStage(projectId, nextId)` + syncs UI `setBbosFilter` + `setActiveBbosStage`
- Handler threaded as `onStageAdvance` prop: ProjectBoard → DashboardView → BbosFullDashboard
- `BBOS_STAGES` imported in BbosFullDashboard to compute `nextStage` from `stageMeta.order`
- `advanceBbosStage` was already in project-store (lines 447–455) but unused — now wired up
- Files: ProjectBoard.jsx, DashboardView.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.css

## [2026-04-14] implement | BBOS pipeline progress tracking wired up
- Added per-stage completion % aggregated from task status (`columnId === doneColumnId || completedAt`)
- Stage header in `BbosFullDashboard.jsx` now shows `X/Y · Z%` with a thin 4px green progress bar below the stage description; computed against all task definitions (not just seeded tasks)
- `ProjectAuditCard` bug fixed: was using `t.completedAt` only for completion count (always null per Sprint 7 fix); now also checks `columnId === doneColumnId`; `doneColumnId` prop passed from parent
- LevelNavigator stage segments now display a `%` completion label below the stage name (e.g. "IDENTITY 0%"); computed via new `pillarProgress` useMemo in `ProjectBoard.jsx`
- Files: BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.css, ProjectBoard.jsx, LevelNavigator.jsx, LevelNavigator.css

## [2026-04-14] implement | Runway date assignment — styled modal with timeline preview
- Replaced raw `confirm()` dialog with `RunwayDateModal` component rendered via `createPortal`
- Modal shows: start-date picker, runway metadata pill, scrollable timeline of all tasks with due dates, overwrite toggle, Apply/Cancel actions
- Live preview recalculates using `useMemo` as start date changes; existing-date rows highlighted with accent tint
- `computePreview()` distributes tasks evenly across runway period (fractions of total ms); `formatPreviewDate()` for display
- CSS: ~200 lines appended to BbosTaskPanel.css — `.rda-overlay`, `.rda-modal`, `.rda-timeline`, `.rda-row`, `.rda-btn` etc.
- Files: BbosTaskPanel.jsx, BbosTaskPanel.css

## [2026-04-14] synthesize | Amanah Gate Protocol — cross-product pattern named via graphify
- Ran `/graphify website/` — 28 HTML pages converted to Markdown, 161 nodes, 162 edges, 38 communities extracted
- Graph found `semantically_similar_to` edge (INFERRED 0.72) between OLOS Confidence Framework and BBOS G-Label System — two independent implementations of the same tiered evidential honesty mechanism
- Traced the pattern: all three products (OLOS, BBOS, MTC) implement Amanah as a decision gate, but BBOS is the only one that named it
- Identified documentation gap: `rationale_land_as_trust` (root homepage) links to OLOS and BBOS but not MTC — the most land-relevant product
- Filed `wiki/decisions/2026-04-14-amanah-gate-protocol.md` — cross-product pattern definition with MTC M1/M2/M3 tier proposal
- Updated `wiki/concepts/amanah-gate.md` — added Protocol section distinguishing ethical gate (halal check) from evidential gate (input quality)
- Updated `website/CONTEXT.md` — cross-product architecture notes, documentation gap, graph reference
- Graph outputs at `website/graphify-out/` (graph.html, GRAPH_REPORT.md, graph.json)

## [2026-04-14] implement | Subsegment colors, TRU task reorder, runway date assignment
- Fixed subsegment in-progress color: `bbosTaskColorFn` now checks `bbosFieldData` for partial field progress, not just `columnId` — tasks with any filled fields show amber even while in the To Do column
- Reordered TRU task definitions: V1/V2/V3/FP02 moved before AF1–AF5, appearing as tasks 7–10 in the Groundwork tab (was 12–15)
- `RESEARCH_PREFIXES` in BbosFullDashboard confirmed as `['S','V','FP']`; V/FP tasks remain in Groundwork, AF tasks in Workshop
- Runway date assignment: when TRU-S5 (Constraint Map) is marked Done, all BBOS tasks in the project receive evenly-spaced due dates from today through the runway period; prompts before overwriting existing dates
- Files: ProjectBoard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosTaskPanel.jsx, bbos-task-definitions.js

## [2026-04-14] implement | Scope gate all views, task panel view-only, color picker
- Extracted shared ScopeGate component from BbosFullDashboard into src/components/shared/ScopeGate.jsx
- Passed bbosRole/bbosFilter to Board (KanbanBoard), List (ListView), and Gantt (GanttView) views
- All 4 views now show "OUTSIDE YOUR SCOPE" overlay when role lacks access to a stage
- Added VIEW ONLY banner + readOnly/disabled fields in BbosTaskPanel for V-access roles
- Added clickable project color picker (8-swatch popover) in ProjectBoard header
- Files: ScopeGate.jsx (new), BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosTaskPanel.jsx/.css, ProjectBoard.jsx, KanbanBoard.jsx, ListView.jsx, GanttView.jsx, TaskDetailPanel.jsx

## [2026-04-14] implement | BBOS role scope gate and access-level badges
- Added "OUTSIDE YOUR SCOPE" overlay (ScopeGate component) when a role has no accessible tasks in a stage
- Overlay shows role name, stage name, and which roles have access (computed from BBOS_TASK_ACCESS matrix)
- Added View/Edit chip badges on task cards reflecting the active role's permission level (V=blue, E=amber)
- Fixed sidebar button width inconsistency (Notifications narrower than Settings)
- Files: BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.css, DashboardTaskCard.css, Sidebar.css

## [2026-04-14] implement | Task modal, BBOS pipeline to Dashboard, LevelNavigator restyle
- Converted TaskDetailPanel and BbosTaskPanel from slide-in side panel to centered popup modal via `createPortal` to `document.body`; Escape key closes, backdrop click closes, panel click stops propagation
- Moved BBOS pipeline overview from BbosFullDashboard to main Dashboard — shows per-stage progress for all BBOS-enabled projects with project title heading
- Removed PipelineOverview internal component + allStageProgress useMemo from BbosFullDashboard (now dashboard-owned)
- Removed bfd__stage-progress bar, bfd__eyebrow, and bfd__title from BbosFullDashboard header (redundant with pipeline on Dashboard)
- LevelNavigator fln__segment-col--current: changed from solid color fill to subtle tint + outline (color-mix 8% + border + box-shadow) matching bfd__pipeline-stage--active style
- fln__segment-nav: 0.7rem, weight 600, var(--text), left-aligned, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.06em — matching bfd pipeline label style
- Files: TaskDetailPanel.jsx/.css, BbosTaskPanel.jsx/.css, ProjectBoard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.jsx, Dashboard.jsx/.css, LevelNavigator.css

## [2026-04-13] rewrite | Landing page — Islamic Life OS framing, Seven Maqasid pillars
- Rewrote Landing.jsx: hero, features, How It Works, FAQ, CTA, footer
- Hero: "Organize your life around what truly matters" with 7 pillar chips (Arabic roots)
- Features: Seven Maqasid tabbed showcase replacing 5-module business framing
- Replaced SaaS pricing with 3-step How It Works (Choose Path → Explore Pillars → Track Growth)
- FAQ rewritten for life OS scope (6 questions)
- Fixed missing `getBbosTaskDef` import in BbosFullDashboard (caused blank page)
- Committed and pushed pre-existing BBOS enhancements (renderers, role picker, task panel, ErrorBoundary)

## [2026-04-13] implement | M2 tier 3 — DLR/RET/OPT/remaining renderer expansion (39→77 tasks, 68% coverage)
- Added 38 new TASK_RENDERERS entries across all remaining stages
- DLR stage: DLR-S5, DLR-A1 (StepPanel), DLR-A2/A4 (Matrix2x2), DLR-A3/A6/A7 (StepPanel), DLR-A5 (DualColumn)
- RET stage: RET-S2/S5 (DualColumn), RET-S3/S4 (Matrix2x2), RET-A1 through RET-A6 (StepPanel)
- OPT stage: OPT-S3 (DualColumn), OPT-S4/S6 (StepPanel), OPT-S5/A5 (VerdictBadge), OPT-S7/A2 (MetricBar)
- OUT/SAL remaining: OUT-A2 (DualColumn), OUT-A3/S1/S2/S3/S5/A1 (StepPanel), SAL-S0/S1/S2/S4/A1/A2 (StepPanel)
- ~36 tasks remain on DefaultTaskRenderer — mostly simple textarea-only or mixed-type fields where default is appropriate
- Build passes clean; no new CSS needed (all reuse existing renderer component styles)

## [2026-04-13] implement | M2 tier 2 — SAL/OUT renderer expansion (28→39 tasks, 35% coverage)

Added 11 new TASK_RENDERERS for SAL and OUT stages using 2 new renderer components.

### New renderer components
- **DualColumnRenderer** — paired textareas side-by-side with optional footer. For content that naturally pairs (objections+responses, scripts+alternatives, nurture+proof)
- **StepPanelRenderer** — vertical numbered cards for sequential/phased content. Numbered circle markers with step labels and truncated content

### New TASK_RENDERERS entries
- **DualColumnRenderer** (5 tasks): OUT-S4 (objection intelligence), OUT-A5 (appointment setter + no-fit scripts), OUT-A6 (objection handling matrix), SAL-A5 (objection library), SAL-S5 (pre-call nurture)
- **StepPanelRenderer** (6 tasks): SAL-S3 (fit call script 3-part), SAL-S6 (show-rate reminders 3-step), SAL-S7 (post-call follow-up), SAL-A4 (fit call asset 3-part), SAL-A6 (combined nurture/reminders/follow-up 4-phase), OUT-A7 (content-to-DM pipeline)

### Running totals
- Total renderers: 39/113 tasks (35%), up from 28 (25%)
- Renderer component inventory: 12 types (CategoryGrid, CandidateTable, Matrix2x2, GateChecks, ProofAudit, TransformationArc, ContentGrid, VerdictBadge, Timeline, SegmentList, MetricBar, ScopeMap, DualColumn, StepPanel)
- Remaining: 74 tasks use DefaultTaskRenderer (~40 are simple textarea-only where default is appropriate)

### Files modified
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — DualColumnRenderer, StepPanelRenderer components + 11 new TASK_RENDERERS entries
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css` — DualColumn styles (2-col grid, footer), StepPanel styles (numbered markers, vertical cards), responsive overrides

## [2026-04-13] implement | M2 — Expand BBOS custom renderer coverage (14→28 tasks)

Extended TASK_RENDERERS from 14 to 28 tasks (25% coverage, up from 12%). Created 2 new renderer components and reused 5 existing ones.

### New renderer components
- **MetricBarRenderer** — horizontal progress bars with color-coded thresholds (green ≥75%, amber ≥40%, red <40%). Used by OPT-S1 (4 canonical metrics) and OPT-A1 (5 stewardship dimensions)
- **ScopeMapRenderer** — two-column included/excluded layout with footer note. Used by OFR-A4 (Scope Map)

### Existing renderers reused for new tasks
- **VerdictBadgeRenderer** (5 new): FND-S3 (gap severity), TRU-S3 (proof strength), TRU-S6 (regulatory status), OFR-A1 (G-label promise), SAL-A0 (assembly status)
- **GateChecksRenderer** (1 new): TRU-FP02 (10-question Amanah screening rubric with ★ auto-disqualifiers using inverted polarity)
- **Matrix2x2Renderer** (3 new): OFR-A6 (guarantee 4-part structure), DLR-S2 (quality/risk quadrants), RET-S1 (4-segment client map)
- **TimelineRenderer** (2 new): DLR-S1 (delivery phases), DLR-S4 (proof capture steps)

### Files modified
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — MetricBarRenderer, ScopeMapRenderer components + 14 new TASK_RENDERERS entries
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css` — MetricBar styles (track/fill/labels), ScopeMap styles (2-col grid, tinted columns), responsive override for scope columns

### Remaining unrendered
85 tasks still use DefaultTaskRenderer. ~42 are simple textarea-only tasks where default rendering is appropriate. Priority expansion candidates: SAL stage (scripts, objection libraries), OUT stage (hook/message libraries), RET stage (message spines).

## [2026-04-13] fix | BBOS Phase 2 — design decisions + remaining high-priority fixes

Resolved 4 design decisions and implemented remaining audit fixes (H2, H3, H6, M5). H5 (sidebar link) dropped by user decision — BBOS accessible through Work projects.

### Design decisions resolved
- **D1 (H2):** Keep `STAGE_SCORE_SIGNALS` centralized config; added `fieldIds` metadata to all 50 signals + dev-time validation that cross-checks against `bbos-task-definitions.js` field IDs (runs in `import.meta.env.DEV` only)
- **D2 (H3):** WAI-ARIA Listbox pattern for BbosRolePicker — arrow keys, Enter/Space select, Escape close, Home/End, `aria-activedescendant`, focus-visible ring
- **D3 (H5):** **Dropped** — user confirmed BBOS lives in Work projects, no sidebar entry needed
- **D4 (H6):** V-prefix stays in Research Factory — clarifying comment added above `RESEARCH_PREFIXES`. V tasks gate research→asset transition; moving them would break Assembly Gate semantics
- **D5 (M5):** Panel-level + per-field + per-section error boundaries on BbosTaskPanel. New shared `ErrorBoundary` component created

### Files modified
- `src/components/shared/ErrorBoundary.jsx` — **new** reusable error boundary (class component with retry UI)
- `src/components/bbos/BbosTaskPanel.jsx` — outer ErrorBoundary wrapping export, per-field boundaries on form fields, AI Draft section boundary
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — V-prefix classification comment, `fieldIds` on all 50 STAGE_SCORE_SIGNALS entries, dev-time validation loop
- `src/components/bbos/BbosRolePicker.jsx` — full rewrite: ARIA listbox, keyboard navigation, focus styling
- `src/components/bbos/BbosRolePicker.css` — **new** extracted styles (was inline)

### Remaining open items
- M2: Only 14/113 tasks have custom renderers
- M10: 5 BBOS skill files referenced but missing from `.claude/skills/`

## [2026-04-13] audit+fix | BBOS comprehensive friction audit and critical remediation

### Audit (3 parallel explore agents)
Scanned BBOS across 3 dimensions: workflow/data integrity, UI components, and system integration. Found **42 total issues** (5 critical, 7 high, 16 medium, 14 low). Agent findings verified against source code — **3 false positives** identified and excluded:
- C1 (grid overflow): CSS Grid auto-wraps correctly — spans per row sum to 12
- C3 (AI draft non-functional): `buildPrompt()` and `parseAiResponse()` ARE implemented in `src/services/ai/`
- C4 (FND Assembly Gate): FND is research-only by design — no Asset tasks needed

### Positive findings
- 100% task/role/Islamic grounding/scoring coverage (113 tasks, 9 stages, 7 roles)
- All 9 stages have 5-signal scoring (contradicts earlier audit's "5/9 unscored" — fixed in Sprint 7)
- moveTask() completedAt fix confirmed working

### Fixes applied (8 issues)
1. **C2 — Debounce cleanup**: Added `useEffect(() => () => clearTimeout(saveTimeout.current), [])` in `BbosTaskPanel.jsx` — prevents stale store writes after panel close
2. **C5 — Atomic task seeding**: `project-store.js` `addProject()` now rolls back orphaned BBOS tasks if project persistence fails (calls `safeRemove`)
3. **H1 — useMemo optimization**: `BbosFullDashboard.jsx` selector narrowed from `s.tasksByProject` (entire map) to `s.tasksByProject[project.id]` — prevents re-computation on unrelated project changes
4. **H4 — useEffect deps**: Added `bbosFilter` to dependency array in `ProjectBoard.jsx:50` — `setActiveBbosStage` now updates when user switches stages
5. **H7 — Assembly Gate null guard**: Gate defaults to open if Done column is missing (`!doneColumnId`)
6. **M1 — Status detection fallback**: Task card status now checks both `columnId === doneColumnId` and `task.completedAt` for completion
7. **M3 — Auto-advance heuristic**: Changed from "10+ total chars across all fields" to "2+ fields with content OR 1 field with 50+ chars" — reduces false triggers
8. **L2 — ratingToStars case-insensitive**: `.toLowerCase()` applied before string matching
9. **L4 — Breakpoint fix**: `max-width: 767px` → `768px` in `BbosFullDashboard.css`
10. **L11 — Score clamping**: `renderStars()` now clamps score to `[0, max]` via `Math.min(Math.max(score, 0), max)`

### Files modified
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — H1, H7, M1, L2, L11
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css` — L4
- `src/components/bbos/BbosTaskPanel.jsx` — C2, M3
- `src/components/work/ProjectBoard.jsx` — H4
- `src/store/project-store.js` — C5

### Remaining open items (not addressed this session)
- H3: BbosRolePicker keyboard navigation (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- H5: BBOS not in sidebar navigation (discovery friction)
- H6: STR-V prefix classification (design decision needed)
- H2: STAGE_SCORE_SIGNALS hardcoded field names (refactoring scope)
- M2: Only 14/113 tasks have custom renderers
- M5: No error boundary on BbosTaskPanel
- M10: 5 BBOS skill files referenced but missing from `.claude/skills/`

## [2026-04-12] ui | AyahBanner polish + family Islamic data

**AyahBanner (TopBar verse banner) — multiple visual fixes:**
- Arabic font set to `'Amiri', serif` (matching Islamic Layer sidebar) — `AyahBanner.css`
- Source citation (`Quran X:Y`) moved from header row to below translation, centered, background removed
- "OPENING REFLECTION" label centered; `flex: 1` removed so `justify-content: center` takes effect; chevron pinned `position: absolute; right`
- Banner overlap with col-edge fixed: `left: 0` → `left: var(--edge-w, 28px)` so banner starts after the 28px column divider
- Topbar z-index raised from 10 → 16 (above col-edge at 15, below sidebar at 20); banner gets opaque surface background via `linear-gradient(--banner-tint, --banner-tint), var(--surface)` to prevent col-edge bleeding through
- Spacing between banner and page content reduced: `--space-6` (24px) → `--space-3` (12px)
- Translation `border-left` accent removed; text-align: center on both Arabic and translation

**Submodule rename — Intellect / Professional:**
- "Professional Mastery" → "Skills Mastery" → "Skill Proficiency" across 5 files: `modules.js`, `pillar-content.js`, `IntellectDashboard.jsx`, `IntellectCorePage.jsx` (INTELLECT_PILLARS array — source of truth for all Intellect level pages), `project-store.js`

**Family Islamic data bootstrapped:**
- Added `family` entry to `MODULE_ATTRS` in `src/data/islamic/islamic-data.js`
- Dua: Quran 25:74 — *Rabbanā hab lanā min azwājinā wa dhurriyyātinā…* (chosen over nikah-specific dua to serve the full Family pillar)
- Governing attrs: Al-Wadud (The Loving) + Al-Qayyum (The Self-Sustaining Sustainer)
- Closing dua: Quran 46:15 — gratitude + righteous offspring
- Full readiness check (3 rows, 3 governing, 3 not-yet) and reflection (3 governing, 3 not-yet)
- Unblocks ThresholdModal Dua tab for all family sub-modules (marriage, parenting, kinship, home)

## [2026-04-12] ui | Pillar page layout redesign — full-width tasks, centered content, segment box navigation

Redesigned the LevelNavigator and pillar/overview page layouts for visual consistency and usability.

- **Full-width task cards:** Removed `fpb-spacer` divs from `PillarLevelPage`; task cards now span the full content area
- **Centered layout:** `max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto` on `fpb-layout` and `flo__grid` for wide-viewport centering
- **Consistent spacing:** Added `padding: var(--space-6)` to PillarLevelPage outer container — verse-banner → navigator gap is now 49px on both overview and pillar pages
- **Segment column boxes:** Each pillar column is a rounded box; active column fills with `--seg-color`; clicking the box navigates to the pillar page
- **New shared components:** `src/pages/shared/` (LevelOverviewPage, PillarLevelPage) and `src/components/shared/` (LevelNavigator)
- **Commit:** `b172e5a` → `onaxyzogden/Maqasid` main

## [2026-04-12] implement | Dashboard refresh — LevelNavigator design language

Rewrote the main dashboard (`/app`) using the Faith module's `LevelNavigator` as the visual reference.

**Changes delivered:**
- **`PillarProgressStrip`** (new component, `src/components/dashboard/PillarProgressStrip.jsx`): 7-column horizontal bar strip, one column per Maqasid pillar. Each bar is subdivided proportionally into done (--col-done green) / in-progress (--col-review amber) / todo (--bg3 gray) segments based on real task data. Pillar accent border-top, Arabic root label in Islamic mode, links to `/app/pillar/:pillarId`.
- **Maqasid Focus panel**: Replaced the "coming soon" placeholder inside `.insight-recommendations` with a live panel listing pillars ranked by open task count (overdue first), with accent-colored left bar, open-task count chip, and Arabic root.
- **Stat cards** trimmed from 4 to 2: In Progress + Overdue. Value font size bumped to 1.8rem.
- **EPH metric** renamed → "Today / tasks completed".
- **Section labels** added: "MAQASID AL-SHARI'AH" (above strip) and "OVERVIEW" (above bottom row).
- **CSS polish**: gap var(--space-6), WF bar height 14px, bottom-row columns 1fr 1.4fr, Space Grotesk labels.

**Bugs found and fixed during session:**
1. PillarProgressStrip was using `useThresholdStore.completedOpening` (ceremony state) to color segments green — not task completion. Rewrote to use `useProjectStore` + `useTaskStore` with project ID prefix resolution (`project.id.startsWith(pillar.id + '_')` as primary, `subModuleIds.includes(project.moduleId)` as fallback).
2. Maqasid Focus `pillarSummary` useMemo used only `subModuleIds.includes(p.moduleId)` — broke for all pillars whose project moduleIds don't match subModuleIds verbatim (faith: 'shahada' vs 'faith-shahada'). Applied same prefix-based fix.

**Key architectural note:** Project ID prefix pattern (`{pillarId}_{submodule}_{level}`) is the reliable pillar resolver. `subModuleIds` fallback covers generic modules (wealth, ummah). Neither `useModulesProgress` hook nor raw `subModuleIds` matching alone is sufficient for faith/life/intellect/family/environment.

## [2026-04-11] graphify | Knowledge graph regeneration (post-audit)

Regenerated graphify knowledge graph after completing all 35 audit findings across 8 sprints.

- **Scope:** `src/ + wiki/ + docs/ + tasks/` (314 files, ~295K words)
- **Graph:** 1,012 nodes, 1,517 edges, 8 hyperedges, 126 communities (25 labeled)
- **Token reduction:** 79.7% (383K raw → 78K graph tokens)
- **Keystone Nodes:** threshold-store (93 edges, bridges 9 communities), project-store (79), contacts-store (49), task-store (34), settings-store (27)
- **Key insight:** threshold-store centrality is intentional (Islamic ceremony gating is cross-cutting), but 63/93 edges are per-page imports that could be lifted to a single router-level `<CeremonyGuard>` wrapper
- **Outputs:** `graphify-out/graph.html`, `graphify-out/graph.json`, `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`
- Updated `wiki/entities/maqasid-os.md` with new graph stats; resolved open question on graph regeneration

## [2026-04-11] implement | Sprint 8 — Documentation & Git Hygiene (#26, #27, #28, #31)

Final sprint of the 35-finding technical audit remediation.

- **#26 CONTEXT.md freshness:** Updated 4 stale files (bbos, work, tech, shared) with current file inventories after Sprint 4-7 additions
- **#27 Wiki entities:** Synced maqasid-os.md and bbos-pipeline.md with Sprint 4-7 history; resolved 3 open questions on bbos-pipeline (Two-Factory UI, G-Label descriptions, Assembly Gate)
- **#28 Lessons learned:** Populated `tasks/lessons.md` with 7 patterns from the remediation (mock data, sessionStorage, quota estimation, pruning, dual stores, CONTEXT.md co-maintenance, false-positive verification)
- **#31 Bundle size ADR:** Created `wiki/decisions/2026-04-11-bundle-size-2mb.md` — accept 2 MB monolithic bundle, revisit at 3 MB or multi-user. Indexed dual-contact-stores ADR from Sprint 5.

**All 35 findings now addressed across 8 sprints.** Branch: `docs/freshness-update`.

## [2026-04-11] audit | Comprehensive 8-submodule system audit

### Scope
Read-only audit across 8 submodules: Build & Lint, BBOS Pipeline Workflow, Dashboard & Navigation, Islamic UI Layer, Store & Persistence, Operational Modules (People/Money/CRM/Office/Tech), Documentation Freshness, Git Hygiene.

### Key findings (35 total: 5 Critical, 12 High, 13 Medium, 5 Low)

**Critical:**
- Rules-of-Hooks violations in ProjectBoard.jsx:87, DashboardView.jsx:17/19, IslamicTerm.jsx:24/36 (conditional hooks)
- safeSet() silently swallows localStorage quota errors — user loses data without notification
- moveTask() resets completedAt to null — tasks appear incomplete in Done column
- BBOS task seeding not atomic — tasks can vanish on reload if second persist fails
- Import (Settings.jsx) has no schema validation or backup — can corrupt entire database

**High:**
- 82 unused vars, 4 impure renders (Date.now in useState/useMemo), 28 exhaustive-deps warnings
- BBOS: auto-advance too permissive, no role filtering in dashboard, 5/9 stages unscored
- Dashboard: no onboarding empty state, pillar dashboards show "Coming Soon"
- Islamic: missing closingDua for People/Wealth pillars, NiyyahAct Skip=Confirm
- Modules: Money dashboard uses mock data, Tech monitoring simulated but unlabeled
- ESLint scans .obsidian/, atlas/, graphify-out/ unnecessarily

**Documentation staleness:**
- 6 CONTEXT.md files stale (work, shared, bbos missing new components)
- Wiki entity pages don't reflect Apr 11 features
- tasks/lessons.md empty despite rapid development

### Files referenced
- Plan: `.claude/plans/bubbly-watching-locket.md`
- Full audit output: conversation log (not persisted to file)

## [2026-04-11] implement | UI polish + unified DashboardTaskCard + BBOS cleanup

- Created `src/components/shared/DashboardTaskCard.jsx` + `.css` — unified card replacing PillarTaskCard and BBOS TaskCard. Whole card clickable; dynamic rendering of subtasks, field progress, due dates, tags, purpose, and custom BBOS renderers via children prop. ~5.4 KB CSS reduction.
- Converted all dashboard audit systems from 5-star to 3-star (BbosFullDashboard, DashboardView, PillarLevelDashboard). Scoring thresholds and verdict logic adjusted for 3-point scale.
- CSS consistency pass: card padding 22px → 20px, star gap 1px → 2px, empty star opacity 0.25 → 0.2 in BbosFullDashboard.css.
- Removed empty card message (`getEmptyMessage`) from BBOS task cards — status communicated via chips and progress bar.
- Removed FND-IFB-S1 through FND-IFB-S5 ("IFB Forms" group) from `bbos-task-definitions.js` and `bbos-role-access.js` — backend admin tasks not operator-facing.
- Tasks page (`/work/:id/tasks`) generic dashboard updated to 3-star audit.

## [2026-04-09] bootstrap | Wiki initialization
- Created wiki directory structure and SCHEMA.md
- Seeded 5 entity pages, 4 concept pages, 3 decision pages, 3 source summaries
- Built initial index.md
- Migrated from NotebookLM-based orientation to wiki-based orientation

## [2026-04-09] implement | Edge column polish + file upload testing
- Polished edge column hover/focus-visible/active states in AppShell.css (primary-bg pattern)
- Boosted dark theme edge line contrast (--border → --border2 override)
- Fixed double `bbiz_` prefix bug in PillarResourcesTab storage key
- Added migration shim for any pre-existing double-prefixed resource data
- E2E tested file upload: txt, pdf, mp3, oversized rejection, link mode, dark theme cards
- Wrote IndexedDB migration design doc (`stages/design-indexeddb-resource-storage-draft.md`)

## [2026-04-11] implement | TRU dynamic scoring + Family Office module

### TRU-AF5 Integrity Threshold — dynamic calculation
- Replaced static `overallProofStrength` lookup with a weighted 5-signal score in `TruDashboard.jsx`
- Signals: TRU-S3.overallProofStrength (max 5) + TRU-V1 gates A/B/C/D (max 5 each) = max 25 pts
- Formula: `Math.round((rawScore / 25) * 100)`
- Verdict thresholds: ≥75% QUALIFIED, ≥50% DEVELOPING, ≥25% REVIEW NEEDED, <25% BLOCKED
- Empty fields score 0 (denominator stays 25)

### TRU-AF5 Audited Claim Strength — dynamic
- Replaced binary pass/fail stars with graduated gate scoring: pass=5★, conditional=3★, fail=1★, empty=0★
- Sub-labels now dynamic: pass → domain label, conditional → "Conditional", fail → "Gate Failed", empty → "Not Assessed"

### Family Office module
- Added Office module to Family section — two access points:
  1. Tab in `FamilyPage.jsx` (`/app/family`) via `mainTab` state + `<Office embedded />`
  2. Dedicated sidebar entry at `/app/family-office` listed under FAMILY after Home Environment
- Files: `FamilyPage.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `maqasid.js` (subModuleIds), `modules.js` (entry), `Sidebar.jsx` (route map)

## [2026-04-11] implement | StageScoreCard — dynamic scoring extended to STR, OFR, OUT

### StageScoreCard component (BbosFullDashboard.jsx)
- Added `StageScoreCard` component rendered above `ProjectAuditCard` for stages with signal definitions
- Reads field values from `taskMap` across multiple tasks, computes weighted score (5 signals × 5 pts = 25 max)
- Verdicts: ≥75% QUALIFIED, ≥50% DEVELOPING, ≥25% REVIEW NEEDED, <25% BLOCKED
- Renders null for stages without signal definitions (FND, SAL, DLR, RET, OPT — unaffected)

### STAGE_SCORE_SIGNALS config
- TRU (5 signals): TRU-S3.overallProofStrength + TRU-V1 gates A/B/C/D — **restores scoring lost when TruDashboard.jsx was deleted**
- STR (5 signals): integrityVerdict, verbatimPhrases line count, contentAngle1-6 filled count, beliefStatement filled, transformation arc fields filled
- OFR (5 signals): promiseGLabel (G1/G2), ICP 4-field completeness, guarantee 4-field completeness, scope map (included+excluded), proofStatus
- OUT (5 signals): icOut1–icOut5 from OUT-IC integrity checks (binary pass=5/fail=0)

### ProofAuditRenderer upgrade (TRU-AF5)
- Claim strength ratings now render as graduated stars via `ratingToStars()`: Strong=5★, Moderate=3★, Weak=2★, Unverifiable/Insufficient=1★
- Unknown rating strings fall back to plain text display

### Helpers hoisted
- `renderStars` moved from inside ProjectAuditCard to module scope (reused by StageScoreCard + ProofAuditRenderer)
- `ratingToStars` helper added

### Files modified
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — STAGE_SCORE_SIGNALS config, StageScoreCard component, ProofAuditRenderer upgrade, renderStars hoist
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css` — `.bfd__ssc-*` styles, `.bfd__audit-rating` flex update, `.bfd__audit-rating-label`, responsive overrides

## [2026-04-11] implement | BbosFullDashboard bento refinements + G-label panel fix

### Bento grid layout
- Switched `.bfd__grid` from `repeat(3, 1fr)` to `repeat(12, 1fr)` 12-column grid
- Replaced `getCardSpan(prefix, indexInGroup)` with `computeGroupSpans(prefix, defs)` — processes defs in pairs, assigns wider span (7) to the task with the longer label, narrower span (5) to the shorter; solo cards at end of odd-count groups span 12; IC prefix always spans 12

### Contextual empty states
- Added `TASK_EMPTY_OVERRIDES` map for all 16 custom-rendered tasks (hand-crafted messages, e.g. "Complete STR-AF1 to populate the core belief statement")
- Added `getEmptyMessage(def)` fallback that derives message from `def.purpose` first sentence for the remaining ~102 tasks
- Purpose line now only shown when card `hasData`; empty cards show only the contextual message

### ProjectAuditCard restored
- Added `ProjectAuditCard` component inside `BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — full-width card at grid bottom
- Computes 4 audit checks (Task Coverage, Completion Rate, Scheduling Discipline, Subtask Depth) scoped to current stage tasks
- STRONG / QUALIFIED / DEVELOPING / NEEDS WORK verdict + health threshold percentage
- Left panel: verdict box; right panel: 2-column star-rated metrics grid

### Completion status backgrounds
- Added `status` computation in `TaskCard`: `empty` / `active` (has data, no completedAt) / `complete` (has completedAt)
- Applied as BEM modifier `bfd__card--${status}` with CSS color-mix tints
- `--active`: faint primary tint + border; `--complete`: faint green tint + border; `--empty`: neutral

### G-Label picker fix
- `BbosTaskPanel.jsx`: gated `GLabelPicker` / Integrity Label row behind `def.hasGLabel`
- Previously rendered unconditionally for all BBOS tasks regardless of flag
- Now only visible on tasks where `hasGLabel: true` (all AF tasks in STR, selected IFB/TRU tasks)

### Files modified
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — computeGroupSpans, getEmptyMessage, TASK_EMPTY_OVERRIDES, ProjectAuditCard, status backgrounds
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css` — 12-col grid, status modifier classes, ProjectAuditCard styles
- `src/components/bbos/BbosTaskPanel.jsx` — def.hasGLabel gate on GLabelPicker

## [2026-04-11] implement | Task card color coding + stage tab status + auto-advance

### Task card status color fix
- Fixed `--active` CSS color: was `var(--primary)` (#4ab8a8 teal → appeared green), changed to `var(--pri-high)` (#f59e0b amber)
- Fixed status detection: was using `task.completedAt` (always null — `moveTask()` resets it explicitly); changed to `task.columnId === doneColumnId`
- `doneColumnId` derived from `project.columns.find(c => c.name === 'Done')?.id` inside `useMemo` in `BbosFullDashboard.jsx`
- Card status now correctly tracks the Kanban column (To Do → neutral, In Progress → amber, Done → green)

### Stage tab color coding (BbosPipelineHeader)
- Added `stageStatusMap` computed in `ProjectBoard.jsx` via `useMemo` — maps each stage ID to `'empty' | 'active' | 'complete'`
- Logic: tasks grouped by stage prefix (`t.bbosTaskType.split('-')[0]`); active = has non-empty `bbosFieldData`; complete = all tasks in Done column
- `stageStatusMap` passed as prop to `BbosPipelineHeader`; applied as `bbos-stage-node--status-${status}` BEM modifier
- CSS: `--status-active` (amber tint) and `--status-complete` (green tint) placed before `--filtered` / `--current` in cascade — filtered/current states always override

### Auto-advance to In Progress
- Added `advanceToInProgress()` helper in `BbosTaskPanel.jsx`: finds "To Do" and "In Progress" columns, calls `moveTask` only if task is currently in "To Do"
- Called in 3 places: (1) `handleFieldChange` — after 300ms debounce, for non-internal non-empty field values; (2) after AI draft field population; (3) after template import
- Does not move tasks backward — condition guards on `task.columnId === toDoCol?.id`

### Files modified
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — doneColumnId in useMemo, TaskCard status fix, amber --active
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css` — `.bfd__card--active` changed to `--pri-high`
- `src/components/work/ProjectBoard.jsx` — stageStatusMap useMemo, stageStatusMap prop on BbosPipelineHeader
- `src/components/bbos/BbosPipelineHeader.jsx` — stageStatusMap prop, status class on each stage node
- `src/components/bbos/BbosPipelineHeader.css` — `.bbos-stage-node--status-active/complete` styles
- `src/components/bbos/BbosTaskPanel.jsx` — advanceToInProgress helper, called from handleFieldChange + AI draft + template import

## [2026-04-09] ingest | NotebookLM migration (Phase 5)
- Queried 3 NotebookLM notebooks: BBOS (84220e85), Maqasid (053ac9ef), Clief Notes (7eb920ab)
- Updated [[bbos-pipeline]] with v2.4 architecture, Two-Factory Model, 7 non-negotiable business rules
- Updated [[maqasid-al-shariah]] with Auda's 6 systems features, ethical screening framework
- Created [[claude-os]] entity page — MWP 3-layer system, 60/30/10 framework, session patterns
- Created [[source-notebooklm-migration]] source summary
- Updated 2 pages, created 2 new pages
- NotebookLM registry marked as legacy — wiki is now authoritative context source

## [2026-04-15] feat+fix | Readiness check card wizard + subtask stage progress

### Readiness check redesign
- Replaced interactive readiness check (all rows visible, small yes/not-yet buttons) with card-based wizard
- One row per page: two side-by-side cards (green=yes, beige=not-yet) with checkmark selection
- Internal Next/Previous navigation, progress counter ("X/Y rows completed")
- Mobile responsive: cards stack vertically at <=480px
- Display-only mode (IslamicPanel sidebar) unchanged
- Files: `src/components/islamic/ReadinessCheck.jsx`, `ReadinessCheck.css`

### Subtask stage progress fix
- BBOS `pillarProgress` now includes fractional credit from subtask completion
- Previously: task with 2/4 subtasks done = 0%. Now: = 50% of that task's weight
- Aligned with `useModuleProgress` hook's `taskWeight()` pattern
- File: `src/components/work/ProjectBoard.jsx` (lines 98-118)

### Commit
- `df242af` — pushed to main

## [2026-04-16] feat(seed-data) | Standardize subtask descriptions with Why/How format

### What was done
- Standardized all subtask descriptions in faith-seed-tasks.js (212 subtasks) and life-seed-tasks.js (236 subtasks) to follow a two-section format:
  - **"Why does this matter?"** — 1-3 sentences grounding the subtask in Islamic significance or practical importance
  - **"How do I accomplish this?"** — actionable steps, details, and verification criteria
- Faith file: reorganized existing unstructured descriptions into the new format
- Life file: created 236 new description fields from scratch (previously had none)
- Sources remain in the separate `sources` field, rendered via the Source(s) button
- Normalized 3 legacy "Why This Matters:" headers to "Why does this matter?"

### Execution approach
- Chunked work into parallel subagents by section (5 batches for faith, 4 for life)
- Each agent handled ~40-60 subtasks within a specific pillar submodule range
- Total: 448 subtask descriptions processed

### Remaining
- Intellect, Family, Wealth, Environment seed files still have subtasks with no descriptions
- Recommended: process in future sessions using the same chunked-agent approach

### Commit
- `fe0a5a9` — pushed to main

## [2026-04-17] feat+chore | Rich Quran/Hadith citation cards + module icon refresh

### Citation cards in subtask Sources view
- `QuranEmbed` — hybrid live quran.com iframe (translations=20 Saheeh, reciter=13, wbw + transliteration, tafsir/reflections/lessons/answers off) with offline `QuranVerseCard` fallback on `!navigator.onLine` or 5s load timeout
- `HadithCard` — bundled offline render of 509 hadith across Bukhari, Muslim, Abi Dawud, Ibn Majah, Nasa'i, Tirmidhi (Amiri Arabic + italic English narration + grade chip)
- `scripts/fetch-hadith.py` — concurrent fetch from fawazahmed0/hadith-api via jsdelivr; writes `src/data/hadith.js`
- `scripts/fetch-quran-wbw.py` — companion fetch for word-by-word
- `TaskDetailPanel` — h3 renderer substitutes embed/card for `### Quran (S:V)` and `### <Collection> N` headings; regex strips inline `**Arabic:** / **Translation:**` narration using sentinel workaround (JS has no `\Z`)
- 9 early-Muslim refs (muslim:5,8,26,33,35,46,49,54,60) render graceful "View on sunnah.com" fallback due to fawazahmed0's 92-hadith intro numbering gap vs sunnah.com canonical
- Musnad Ahmad skipped — no fawazahmed0 edition

### Seed-task copy & layout
- "Why does this matter?" → "Why?", "How do I accomplish this?" → "How?" across all 7 seed files
- "Sources from the Quran/Hadith" → "Quran/Hadith"
- Removed `---` HR divider between Why and How; CSS hides any residual hr inside subtask content
- "Source(s)" button and heading → "Source"
- Amiri font applied across DuaSection, TodayFocus, Ummah, HadithCard

### Module icon refresh (lucide-react 0.511 → 1.8)
- Circulation & Impact: `Gift` → `CircleFadingArrowUp`
- MTC Residency: `Building` → `HousePlus`
- MTC Land: `Mountain` → `MapPinned`
- Collective: `UsersRound` → `Shapes`
- Lucide bump required for `HousePlus` / `MapPinned`; Vite dep cache cleared (`rm node_modules/.vite`) to clear stale pre-bundle
- Icon strings synced across `modules.js`, `Sidebar.jsx` ICON_MAP, `TaskDetailPanel` ICON_MAP, `CeremonyGate`, `ModulePlaceholder`, `WealthCorePage`, `WealthDashboard`, `project-store`

### Commits
- `1ae2793` feat(sources) — pushed to main
- `cd5bd55` chore(icons) — pushed to main

### Decisions filed
- [[2026-04-17-quran-hadith-citation-cards]]
- [[2026-04-17-lucide-react-1-8-upgrade]]

### Deferred
- Re-fetch Muslim using sunnah.com canonical numbering to fill 9 empty entries
- Find a Musnad Ahmad source
- Intellect, Family, Wealth, Environment seed files still have bare subtasks with no Why/How descriptions

## 2026-04-17 — Ummah pillar → PillarLevelPage pattern

### Context
All 6 Ummah submodule pages used legacy `PillarHeader + ViewToggle + OverviewCards/MaqasidTable` layout. User requested Shahada-style layout (compact level navigator + kanban board) for parity with Faith.

### Scaffold built
- `UMMAH_BOARDS` (18 entries: collective/neighbors/community/moontrance-{land,seasonal,residency} × core/growth/excellence) added to `src/store/project-store.js`
- `ensureUmmahProjects` store action (mirrors `ensureFaithProjects`) — seeds from `UMMAH_SEED_TASKS` via `seedTasks()` helper
- `src/pages/ummah/UmmahLevelNavigator.jsx` — exports `UMMAH_PILLARS` (6), `UMMAH_LEVEL_ROUTES` (fallback to `/app/pillar/ummah`), `UMMAH_STORAGE_KEY`, `UMMAH_ENSURE_PROJECTS`
- `src/pages/ummah/UmmahPillarPage.jsx` — wraps shared `PillarLevelPage` with `boardPrefix="ummah"` and identity `UMMAH_PILLAR_MODULE_MAP`

### Page rewrites (6 files)
- `MoontraceLandPage.jsx`, `MoontranceSeasonalPage.jsx`, `MoontranceResidencyPage.jsx`
- `CollectivePage.jsx`, `Neighbors.jsx`, `Community.jsx`
- All now: `export default function X() { return <UmmahPillarPage pillarKey="..." />; }` — CeremonyGuard already wraps at route level

### UmmahDashboard updated
- Imports all 6 OVERVIEW + MAQASID datasets
- New "Frameworks" section with collapsible `<details>` per submodule (accent-colored border from `--mod-*` tokens)
- CSS (`.ummah-framework*`) appended to `UmmahDashboard.css`
- Label quirk preserved: `collective` id displays "MTC", `community` id displays "Collective" — matches existing module-id/label mapping in `modules.js`

### Verification
- `npm run build` passes (2645 modules, 1.28s)
- Manual walkthrough not performed — deferred to user

### Deferred
- `useAyahBanner('ummah_*')` no longer invoked from submodule pages — needs re-wiring in `UmmahPillarPage` or `PillarLevelPage` if desired
- Dedicated `/app/ummah-{core,growth,excellence}` level-overview routes (Faith-style `LevelOverviewPage`)
- Citation verification for 450 subtasks in `ummah-seed-tasks.js` (generated in prior session by 6 parallel agents; hadith isnad and translation accuracy never audited)

### Decision filed
- [[2026-04-17-ummah-pillar-level-page]]

## 2026-04-17 — Ayah banner label + 99 Names kid-friendly rewrite

### Context
Two small user-driven UI tasks in one session.

### Done
- `src/components/layout/TopBar.jsx:225` — changed ayah banner label from "Reminder" to "Why?" (triggered via selected-element: TopBar banner header)
- `C:\Users\MY OWN AXIS\Downloads\99_names_of_allah.html` (out-of-repo artifact) — added 7th `kidFriendly` field (2-sentence child-accessible explanation) to all 99 entries in the `names` array; replaced standalone "View toggle" design with a combined card layout showing scholarly label + kid-friendly paragraph stacked. New `.meaning-label` style (small italic). Search now also matches kid-friendly text. Doctrinally grounded — harsher names (Al-Khafid, Al-Mudhill, Al-Muntaqim, Ad-Darr, Al-Jabbar) rendered gently but accurately.

### Verification
- TopBar change: single-line text edit, no build run (trivial)
- 99 Names HTML: standalone file, opens directly in browser — verification deferred to user

### Deferred
- Doctrinal spot-check of the 99 kid-friendly descriptions by a qualified reviewer before any public use
- Plan file at `~/.claude/plans/c-users-my-own-axis-downloads-99-names-precious-cerf.md` can be archived/removed

### Notes
- Session did not open the repo wiki via the 3-Gate protocol — tasks were point-edits flagged by the user via selected-element and an attached out-of-repo HTML file. Formal orientation was skipped; noting it here for audit.

## 2026-04-17 — TaskDetailPanel polish + seed-source bug fixes

### Context
Continuation session covering UI polish on TaskDetailPanel, a silent-failure bug in seed hydration, and a source-curation audit on the "Six Pillars of Iman" task.

### Done
- `src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.css` — restored header/footer contrast (`.tdp-header`, `.tdp-project-name`, `.tdp-footer`, `.tdp-later-btn` now use `var(--surface)` / `var(--text)` instead of washed-out greys)
- `src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.jsx:342,550,591` — renamed "Complete later" / "Back to subtask" buttons to "Back"
- `src/data/seed-tasks/faith-seed-tasks.js` — first Shahada subtask source replaced (Sahih Muslim 6384 → Sahih Bukhari 8); "Reflect on what 'no god but Allah' demands" subtask sources updated to Quran 65:3, 98:5 + Bukhari 16, 9
- **Curly-quote bug** — diagnosed silent failure where Edit-introduced U+201C/U+201D in subtask titles broke `seed-hydrator.js:42,55,97` exact-string matching. Audited all 7 seed files: only 5 affected lines (4 in faith, 1 in ummah), all U+2019 in apostrophe positions (Jumu'ah, Ka'bah, Isma'il, du'a). Normalized to ASCII apostrophe.
- `src/components/islamic/QuranEmbed.jsx:57` — added `scrolling="no"` to the Quran.com iframe to suppress nested scrollbar
- **Six Pillars of Iman audit** ([faith-seed-tasks.js:535–712](src/data/seed-tasks/faith-seed-tasks.js#L535)) — fixed 4 source mismatches:
  - Pillar 1 (Allah): swapped Quran 30:56 (Last-Day verse) + Bukhari 16 (sweetness of faith) → Quran 2:163, 2:255, 3:18 + Muslim 8
  - Pillar 4 (Messengers): added Quran 2:285, 4:164, 33:40; replaced lone Bukhari 9 (haya hadith — irrelevant) with Bukhari 4777
  - Pillar 5 (Last Day): added Quran 99:7, 101:4; replaced Bukhari 3611 (khawarij — tangential) with Muslim 8
  - Pillar 6 (Qadar): removed Quran 97:1 and Bukhari 49 (both about Laylat al-Qadr, not divine decree — homonym confusion)

### Verification
- `npm run build` passes (1.32s / 1.40s)
- Audit grep `title:.*[\u2018\u2019\u201C\u201D]` returns 0 matches across `src/data/seed-tasks/`
- Preview navigation through all 4 fixed Iman subtasks confirms correct hadith/ayah cards render via HadithCard / QuranEmbed

### Deferred
- Multi-verse Quran ranges (e.g. `(112:1-4)`) don't match the `^Quran \((\d+):(\d+)\)$` regex in `TaskDetailPanel.jsx:522` — render as plain h3 with stripped Arabic/translation. Existing data uses ranges in places; needs a separate fix to handle ranges in QuranEmbed
- Source-curation audit only covered the "Six Pillars of Iman" task (5 of ~270 faith subtasks); other subtasks may have similar mismatches
- The full hadith narration text inline in seed `sources` markdown is redundant — stripped at render. Could be removed in a future cleanup pass

### Notes
- Session opened mid-flow from a prior compacted conversation; no formal 3-Gate orientation. All work was triggered by user requests on specific UI/data issues.

## 2026-04-19 — Dashboard Sanctuary Mode + rollover self-healing

### Context
Continuation of the Ad-lib Niyyah work. The authored sentence (feeling → pillar → submodule) was persisted and surfaced in ManifestoBanner, but the dashboard itself still treated all eight pillars uniformly. Six-phase revamp + follow-up rollover wiring + echo verification.

### Done
- **Phase 1 — Task schema + backfill:** added `pillarId` / `submoduleId` fields to task records; `backfillPillarFields()` idempotent one-shot action on `useTaskStore` gated by `bbiz_task_pillar_migrated_v1` sentinel; `getFocusTasks(submoduleId)` selector returning `{ deepWork, maintenance }`.
- **Phase 2 — Sun & Stars layout:** `--dashboard-accent` CSS var on `.insight` root when niyyah is complete. Primary pillar card on `TodayFocusSection` gets `--sun` (tint, glow, 1.2× type scale); secondary pillars get `--star` demotion. `PillarProgressStrip` bars dimmed to 40% for non-focus pillars.
- **Phase 3 — Guided Task List:** new `FocusTaskList.jsx` — Today's Deep Work (primary section) + collapsible "Keep the Lights On" with count badge. Hidden when niyyah incomplete or skipped.
- **Phase 4 — Ripple Ring + toast:** new `RippleRing.jsx` SVG ring bound to focus-submodule completion %, positioned at top-right of Sun card. 2-second-debounced toast *"One step closer to your {pillar.sidebarLabel}"* on Deep Work completion via `useToastStore`.
- **Phase 5 — Context Widget Slot:** new `ContextWidgetSlot.jsx` with `submoduleId → Component` registry. Widgets: `PrayerCountdownWidget` (extracted shared `useNextPrayer` hook from `PrayerOverlay.jsx`), `PomodoroWidget` (self-contained useReducer, no persistence), `HydrateWidget` (localStorage glass counter), `PriorityProjectWidget` (top open project from `project-store`). Fallback "Focus Tip" card for unmapped submodules.
- **Phase 6 — Evening Reflection:** `niyyahReflection` slice on `threshold-store` with `saveReflection({ feeling, note })`; archived into `niyyahHistory` entry on day-rollover. `EveningReflectButton` appears when Deep Work completion ≥ 50% OR hour ≥ 18. `EveningReflectModal.jsx` reuses the 12-pill ḥāl al-qalb grid for evening feeling.
- **Day-rollover self-healing:** added `rolloverIfStale` action to `threshold-store` (idempotent — early-returns when `niyyahDate === today`). Archives stale niyyah with nested reflection via `archiveStaleNiyyah(get, today)` then clears current-day slots in memory + localStorage (`thr_niyyah_date`, `_feeling`, `_submodule`, `_reflection`; resets `_focus` to `[]`). Wired to Dashboard mount via dedicated useEffect at `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx:310-312`.
- **Yesterday's Echo verified:** morning Niyyah modal step 2 renders `.niyyah-echo` block when `niyyahHistory[last].date === yesterday`. Text: *"Yesterday, you tended to {submodule} with a heart of {feeling}. You closed the day feeling {evening feeling}. Want to chase that feeling again?"* + "Continue the journey" button prefilling Ad-lib with yesterday's values.

### Verification
- Phases 1–6 verified via preview_eval + preview_snapshot + manual interaction during session.
- `rolloverIfStale` verified end-to-end: seeded `bbiz_thr_niyyah_date = '2026-04-17'` + reflection in localStorage + in-memory store → invocation returned `true` → history gained entry with nested `reflection.feeling: 'sakinah'` → all current-day keys cleared in both memory and localStorage (prefix-aware test — the `bbiz_` prefix from `services/storage.js` was the root cause of earlier false negatives).
- Echo verified at `/app` with seeded 2026-04-18 history entry: modal step 2 rendered *"Yesterday, you tended to Learning & Literacy with a heart of Yearning. You closed the day feeling Settled tranquility. Want to chase that feeling again?"*

### Deferred
- Geometric tile / Islamic-pattern variant of the ripple ring (v1 uses plain SVG circle).
- Widgets beyond the four mapped submodules — other submodules fall back to the generic Focus Tip card.
- Pomodoro widget state persistence across reloads (acceptable for v1).
- Reflection comparison history UI (past N days) — data stored, only yesterday's echo surfaced.

### Notes
- HMR fragmentation bug made preview_eval-based verification noisy — `location.reload()` within the iframe didn't always re-evaluate dynamically-imported modules. Workaround: force in-memory store state + localStorage state jointly, then invoke actions directly.
- `services/storage.js` uses a `bbiz_` prefix on every key — tests seeding localStorage raw (without prefix) will diverge from what the store reads. Always seed through `safeSet` or use the prefix explicitly.
- ADR filed: `wiki/decisions/2026-04-19-dashboard-sanctuary-mode.md`.

## 2026-04-21 — Threshold reframe: orient, don't excuse

### Context
The Opening Threshold ceremony had been behaving like a gate: "Am I ready?" with a "Defer to Later" off-ramp on the Pause screen, plus a Confirm checkbox gating the final Begin. This contradicted the operating principle that the work gets done regardless of feeling — the threshold's job is to orient, not to excuse. Two-phase reframe this session.

### Done
- **Phase A — Defer removal (universal) + readiness reframe (faith-salah):** dropped `DEFER_CONTENT`/`DEFER_UNIVERSAL` imports, `deferOpening` store selector, `showingDeferScreen` state, `closeDeferScreen`/`defer` functions, defer-screen ternary branch, and the Defer footer button from `ThresholdModal.jsx`. Pause content branch now data-driven on `data?.pauseWarning && data?.pauseRiseNow` instead of the `noDefer` flag. Reframed `faith-salah.readiness` in `islamic-data.js`: frame shifted from *"Am I ready to begin?"* to *"What am I bringing into this prayer?"*; row labels shifted from *"I can…"* / *"I am still…"* to *"I am bringing…"* / *"I am carrying…"*; `noDefer` flag removed; Maryam 19:59 `pauseWarning` and Ali 'Imran 3:133 `pauseRiseNow` retained.
- **Phase B — Confirm removal + Bismillah finalize:** dropped the Confirm step entirely from the `baseSteps` array, along with `confirmed` state, the Confirm render block, and `returnToReadiness`. Footer finalize now uses an IIFE that renders a single `thr-btn-bismillah` button — `<span class="thr-btn-label">Bismillah</span><span class="thr-btn-arabic arabic" dir="rtl">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ</span>` (opening) or the Alhamdulillah pair (closing) — on three trigger conditions: Readiness all-yes, Pause, and Closing Dua. Previous button preserved on Pause so users can back out without escaping.

### Verification
- `npm run dev` / Vite HMR compiled clean after both waves of edits (earlier parse-error log entries resolved before commit).
- Preview walkthrough on `/app/prophetic-path-test` via Before pill → steps strip shows Dua → Allah ﷻ → Ready? with no Confirm step.
- All-yes on 4 readiness rows: footer rendered Bismillah button with English label at x=704 and Arabic span at x=773 (English-left / Arabic-right confirmed); clicking it closed the modal and completed the ceremony.
- At-least-one nyt: pause button appeared; clicking it advanced to Pause step showing Maryam 19:59 + Ali 'Imran 3:133 + "This prayer has not yet left its time. Rise." + Bismillah finalize + Previous — no Defer button.

### Deferred
- Reframe readiness copy for the other six pillars (Life, Intellect, Family, Wealth, Environment, Ummah) and their sub-modules using the `faith-salah` shape as template.
- Remove orphan `.thr-defer-*` CSS rules and `DEFER_CONTENT` / `DEFER_UNIVERSAL` constants from `islamic-data.js`.
- Remove `deferOpening` / `deferred` / `isDeferred` from `threshold-store.js` after auditing callers (left intact as dead-but-harmless API this pass).
- `.thr-btn-bismillah` uses `justify-content: center` with `gap: 8px` — consider `space-between` + `min-width` for more deliberate anchoring of the English/Arabic pair.

### Notes
- `pauseWarning && pauseRiseNow` is now the branch condition for the "rise now" Pause layout — cleaner than a boolean flag, since the data's presence implies the ceremony carries the covenant weight needed to warrant that specific rendering.
- Commits: `8cc1e4a` (scoped feat on the two files), `c4e39e7` (working-tree snapshot of graphify cache + wiki + seeds + tooling).
- ADR filed: `wiki/decisions/2026-04-21-threshold-orient-not-excuse.md`.

## 2026-04-21 — Threshold defer-orphan cleanup (partial)

### Context
Follow-up sweep from the threshold reframe earlier today. Prior session-close recommended "ripple naming-style readiness across 6 pillars + retire orphan defer artifacts in one sweep." Entered this session to execute that. Scope collapsed on discovery.

### Done
- **Ripple = no-op.** Spot-checked every `readiness:` block in `src/data/islamic/islamic-data.js` (60+ blocks across MODULE_ATTRS + UNIVERSAL_EQUIV). Every block already uses naming-style copy with domain-specific framing — e.g. `work` frames as *"Al-Muhsin asks: am I bringing ihsan to this work, or just getting it done?"* with `yesLabel: 'I am bringing ihsan when'`. Only `faith-salah` had been generic gate-style, and that was fixed yesterday (commit `8cc1e4a`). My 2026-04-21 session-close recommendation was based on an un-verified assumption from the explore agent.
- **Retire (partial).** Deleted `DEFER_CONTENT` and `DEFER_UNIVERSAL` constants from `islamic-data.js` (0 import sites), and the six `.thr-defer-*` CSS rules from `ThresholdModal.css` (0 selectors in use). 64 lines of dead code removed. Commit `4e6a720`.

### Deferred
- **Store-level retire.** `deferOpening` / `deferred` / `isDeferred` in `src/store/threshold-store.js` left in place because callers exist beyond `ThresholdModal`: `CeremonyGate.jsx` (isDeferred → "Return to Opening" UI branch + distinct copy), `Dashboard.jsx:229` (selector), `PillarCard.jsx:32,60` (prop threading + per-module read), `ModuleHealthCard.jsx:6,18,21` (isDeferred prop + yellow status badge via `.mhc-status-deferred`), and `HealthPulse.jsx:9` (cosmetic string). The paths are semantically dead (nothing can ever set `deferred[moduleId]=true` after the defer exit was removed) but removing them changes visible UI and warrants a caller-aware diff pass.
- **CONTEXT.md refresh.** `src/components/islamic/CONTEXT.md` still documents the Defer system; update when the store sweep lands.

### Notes
- Lesson: session-close debriefs must cite *verified* state, not speculative "what's left." The "ripple 6 pillars" recommendation should have been validated against the data file before being written — it would have taken 30 seconds to disprove.
- Commit: `4e6a720` chore(threshold): delete orphan defer constants + CSS (0 callers).

## 2026-04-22 — Maqasid Comparison Wheel Round 5 (Nur Aura + Mithaq Activation)

### Context
Continuation of the iterative UI/UX upgrade sprint on the Maqasid Comparison Wheel. Rounds 1–4 addressed information clarity (OKLCH palette, compass needle, wisdom tooltip, pathfinding card, inked-stroke milestones, cross-component hover sync with LevelNavigator, courageous label pruning, icon parity). Scholar consultation `2b89f729` (notebook `995a59d1`) diagnosed two remaining gaps: "Floating Icon Syndrome" (empty outer band after label prune) and the passive-display problem (no ceremony to engage the wheel).

### Done
- **Nur Aura + Icon Bloom.** `wheelColor.js` gained `brightAura` field (OKLCH L=0.78 — gold/teal/purple at equal perceived lightness). Each pillar icon wrapped in `.mcw-pillar-vessel` `<g>` containing a radial-gradient `<circle>` + foreignObject icon. Hover → aura opacity 0→0.75 + scale 1.6× + icon scale 1.22× with drop-shadow glow. 100% complete → persistent lit state (replaces Round 2 halo-pulse).
- **Mithaq Activation Ritual.** New `src/store/mithaqStore.js` (Zustand + `zustand/middleware` persist) with per-domain activation expiring at next 5am local (Fajr proxy). New `src/hooks/useMithaqHold.js` — RAF state machine: idle → holding (1500ms) → activated | draining (280ms ease-in). Ref-based tick functions avoid self-referencing-useCallback lint.
- **Wheel integration.** `mithaqDomain` prop gates dormancy. Dormant state: sectors desaturated (opacity 0.4 + saturate 0.5), empty-dashes dimmed, needle/next-action-card/wisdom-tooltip all suppressed via `!isDormant` gate, hub shows muted "FAITH" + `Press & hold to renew` Amiri italic hint. Hub group is the press target (`role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, aria-label). Shimmer ring at `r=HUB_R+4` with `pathLength=1`, `strokeDashoffset={1 - mithaqProgress}`, `transform={rotate(-90)}` — draws clockwise as user presses. Pressed-state tactile `scale(0.975)`.
- **Ignition choreography.** Driven by `onActivate` event handler (not `useEffect` watching `isLit`) — avoids setState-in-effect and also means page reload while already activated does NOT replay the animation. 80ms silence → `.mcw-svg--igniting` triggers keyframes per vessel with `animation-delay: 80ms + i*50ms`. Aura: opacity 0→0.9→0.55, scale 0.6→1.35→1.15. Icon: scale 0.85→1.3→1 with drop-shadow bloom. `<div role="status" aria-live="polite">` announces "FAITH covenant renewed."
- **Accessibility.** Keyboard Space/Enter press-and-hold, Escape aborts, `:focus-visible` ring on hub group. `prefers-reduced-motion` extended to disable every aura/bloom/ignite/hint-pulse animation.
- **Wired** `mithaqDomain: 'faith'` into `FaithLevelOverview.jsx`'s `wheelExtraProps`. Faith pages dormant-until-renewed; other pillars inherit aura-on-hover with no dormancy.
- Build 2703 → **2706 modules** (+store + hook + persist middleware), lint clean.

### Deferred
- **Muraqabah Commitment Pips** (Round 6) — small radial dots on inner band edge for daily sub-units (e.g., 5 pips for Salah's 5 prayers).
- **Sacred Pattern Masking** (Round 6) — Girih / 8-point-star SVG pattern fading in on hover.
- **Status-based icon morphing** — Moon crescent → full for Siyam, dual-crescent for Hajj. Per-pillar craft.
- **Fajr prayer-time integration** — replace the 5am proxy with the user's actual local Fajr.
- **Covenant streak ring** — consecutive-day activation ring; blocked on historical persistence (same block as the Round 2 momentum ghost arc).
- **Sound on activation** — glass-tap / ney-flute note; audio-design sprint.

### Notes
- Chose single domain key (`'faith'`) over per-level keys (`'faith-core'/growth/excellence'`) — activating once covers the whole Maqasid hemisphere for the day; more generous, better reflects *tajdīd al-ʿahd* being holistic.
- Chose `brightAura` as the fifth `wheelColor.js` output rather than computing it inline — future features (commitment pips, ghost arc, pattern masking) get perceptual coherence for free when they consume it.
- Ignition animation is event-driven (fires from `onActivate` callback), not state-driven (watching `isLit`). This had the bonus of cleanly avoiding the setState-in-effect lint rule AND matching the ritual semantics (the animation is *the moment of the act*, not a reaction to stored state).
- The shimmer ring's `strokeDashoffset` is inline-driven by the hook's RAF tween — no CSS transition on that property. Keeps drain-from-early-release and fresh-press-over-draining unambiguous: one source of truth for ring fill.
- ADR filed: `wiki/decisions/2026-04-22-mithaq-activation-nur-aura.md`.

## 2026-04-22 — UI polish: wizard crossfade, mobile panel slide-out, source-card dark mode

### Context
Three targeted UI polish items surfaced via live preview inspection — no architectural change, just replacing abrupt/broken transitions and a legibility bug.

### Done
- **ReadinessCheck wizard crossfade.** `RCInteractive` previously advanced instantly on card-select and only faded the incoming row in. Added `exiting` state during the 320ms auto-advance window; applied `rcCrossfadeOut` keyframe (opacity 1→0 + 4px lift) to the `.rc-card-content--exiting` wrapper's children (group-header, frame, card-row). Pairs with the existing `rcCrossfadeIn` so both rows now participate in a true crossfade. Wrapper uses `display: contents`, so animations are declared per-child rather than on the wrapper itself. Files: `src/components/islamic/ReadinessCheck.{jsx,css}`.
- **Mobile Islamic panel slide-out.** `AppShell.jsx` only had a mount-time `il-slide-in` animation — closing unmounted instantly. Added `mobileIlRender` + `mobileIlClosing` state: when `islamicPanelOpen` flips false, render stays true for 220ms and `--closing` modifier classes go onto `.il-mobile-backdrop` / `.il-mobile-panel`. New `il-fade-out` + `il-slide-out` keyframes (200ms ease, `forwards`) play before unmount. Verified via `getAnimations()` + `getBoundingClientRect().x`: panel animates from `translateX(0)` → `translateX(100%)` across the 200ms window. Files: `src/components/layout/AppShell.{jsx,css}`.
- **Subtask source cards dark mode.** `.tdp-grounding-source` was using `color-mix(in oklab, var(--bg-muted, #f8fafc) 60%, transparent)` but `--bg-muted` is undefined in both theme scopes of `tokens.css`, so the fallback hex `#f8fafc` always won — washed pale card on dark bg, killing text contrast. Also three inline-style hardcoded slate hexes in `SubtaskSources.jsx` (grade chip `#64748b`, sunnah.com link `#64748b`, rationale `#475569`) bypassed the theme entirely. Swapped card bg to `var(--bg3)` at 70% (dark: `#22262e`, light: `#f1f3f5`); swapped grade chip to `var(--text3)` + `color-mix(... var(--text3) 12%/25%, transparent)`; dropped inline color on link wrapper (lets `<a>` inherit default link color); swapped rationale to `var(--text2)`. Computed-style verification in dark mode: card bg resolves to near-black oklab, rationale resolves to `#9e9690`, contrast on card ~4.8:1 (AA). Files: `src/components/work/SubtaskSources.jsx`, `src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.css`.

### Deferred
- **Light-mode visual regression check** of source cards — computed tokens suggest no change, but screenshot tool went unresponsive during verification. Worth a 30-second theme-toggle eyeball when next in that view.
- **ThresholdModal crossfade is local to the wizard rows only** — if the whole modal step (header + progress + nav) ever needs a true crossfade between steps, the `.thr-step-anim` wrapper would need the same exiting treatment as `.rc-card-content`.

### Notes
- `--bg-muted` token referenced by `.tdp-grounding-source` is a phantom: not in `:root` or `[data-theme="dark"]`. Grep for it returned zero definitions. Treat any future `var(--bg-muted, ...)` sightings as candidates for the same bug — fallback always wins.
- For the mobile panel close animation, the CSS cascade alone isn't enough — the element must stay mounted long enough for the keyframes to play. The render/closing double-state is the minimal pattern and should be reused for any other fade/slide-out on an unmount.
- The ReadinessCheck wrapper uses `display: contents` so that its children participate in the parent flex gap. That design choice prevents animating opacity/transform on the wrapper itself — hence the animation-on-each-child approach.
- No ADR — all three are pattern-level polish, not architectural decisions.

## 2026-04-23 — Landing hero scholar-led polish phase 1

### Context
User surfaced the MILOS landing hero via preview. Consulted UI/UX Design Scholar NotebookLM (`995a59d1-...`) for a "awesome modern landing page" brief tailored to a values-driven product. Scholar returned a six-part blueprint (typography, CTA, social proof, visual interest, value-prop grid, common mistakes). This session executes items 1–3; items 4–5 tee up next.

### Done
- **Sacred Serif H1.** `.hero-title` switched from inherited sans (700wt) to `'Cormorant Garamond', 'EB Garamond', Georgia, ...` at weight 300, letter-spacing -0.02em, line-height 1.15, size `clamp(2.75rem, 6.5vw, 4.25rem)`. Kept the `.highlight` teal→sand gradient on the tail fragment. Verified via `getComputedStyle`: resolved font-family chain, weight 300, letter-spacing -0.88px. File: `src/styles/landing.css`.
- **Soul-language copy.** H1: *"Organize your life around what truly matters"* → *"Align your daily rhythm with what truly matters"*. Primary CTA: *"Get Started Free"* → *"Begin Your Path"*. Scholar proposed *"Align your daily rhythm with the Divine"*; softened to preserve universal-ethics onboarding path. File: `src/pages/Landing.jsx`.
- **Qalb-intent CTA press state.** Scoped `.hero-cta .btn:active { transform: scale(0.97); transition: transform 80ms var(--ease); }` — deliberately local to the hero so global `.btn-primary` stays untouched across the rest of the app. File: `src/styles/landing.css`.
- **Ummah-signal marquee.** New `.hero-marquee` block inserted between `.hero-cta` and `.hero-modules`. Six trust-signal items (*Grounded in the Maqasid al-Shari'ah · Local-first · Zero tracking · Seven pillars · Free forever · Built with tawakkul*) duplicated 2× for seamless wrap; 40s linear `translateX(0 → -50%)`; `mask-image` gradient fades both edges 0–12% / 88–100% (scholar's "progressive blur"); `aria-hidden="true"`; respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. Files: `src/pages/Landing.jsx`, `src/styles/landing.css`.
- **ADR filed** — `wiki/decisions/2026-04-23-landing-hero-scholar-polish.md`.

### Deferred
- **Cormorant Garamond webfont load** — currently relies on system fallback (Georgia) where Cormorant is absent; deliberate zero-dep phase-1 posture. Add `@import` or `<link>` in phase 2.
- **Item 4 "Breaking the box"** — 3D Faith gold ring overlapping hero edge + Maqasid Pulse 4s shimmer along a circular stroke. Queued for next phase.
- **Item 5 Bento pillar grid** — replace current `.hero-modules` chip row with 7 bento cards, each carrying a 0% Mastery Ring and progressive-disclosure hover description. Queued for next phase.
- **Item 6 warm dark background** (`#1a1611`) — theme-level change, not hero-scoped; out of scope for this session.

### Notes
- Scholar answer IDed this kind of generic-sans hero as "corporate AI mush" aesthetic; three single-file edits materially shift the first-paint feel without any new dependency or font-loading risk.
- Scoping CTA press state via `.hero-cta .btn:active` instead of touching `global.css > .btn-primary:active` avoids a blast-radius problem across the app's several hundred primary-button uses.
- Marquee uses a two-child duplication pattern inside a single `.hero-marquee-track` translating `-50%` — standard seamless-loop shape. Keeps item count reasoning simple (12 = 6 × 2).
- Screenshot timed out twice before succeeding; `preview_eval` style introspection was the faster verification path for typography + animation.

## 2026-04-23 — Landing hero scholar-led polish phase 2

### Context
Continued the UI/UX Scholar consult from earlier today. Phase 1 delivered typography + copy + CTA + marquee; phase 2 addresses the two items with the biggest remaining perceived-quality delta: scholar item 4 ("breaking the box" visual anchor + Maqasid Pulse) and item 5 (Bento pillar grid with Mastery Rings + progressive disclosure).

### Plan adjustment
Scholar suggested a two-column hero split. I kept the hero single-column (the editorial serif H1 wants the centered full width) and anchored the Faith ring as an **absolute-positioned** decorative element clipping past the section's right edge. Scholar's "breaking the box" intent preserved without sacrificing the headline's presence.

### Done
- **Break-the-box Faith ring.** New `.hero-ring` element at `position: absolute; top: calc(var(--nav-h) + var(--space-8)); right: -120px; width/height: 360px`. Inline SVG with two concentric circles (r=160): a low-opacity gold `.hr-track` and a `.hr-shimmer` stroked with a 3-stop transparent→gold→transparent `<linearGradient>`, `drop-shadow` for ambient glow, and a Compass Lucide icon + "Faith / حفظ الدين" bilingual label centered inside. `.hero-section { overflow: hidden; position: relative; }` prevents horizontal scroll; `@media (max-width: 1024px) { .hero-ring { display: none; } }` hides it on tablet/mobile. All existing hero children lifted to `position: relative; z-index: 1` to stack above the `z-index: 0` ring. Files: `src/pages/Landing.jsx`, `src/styles/landing.css`.
- **Maqasid Pulse (4s shimmer along circular stroke).** `@keyframes maqasidPulse { 0% { stroke-dashoffset: 1005; } 100% { stroke-dashoffset: 0; } }` — 4s linear infinite. Shimmer circle has `strokeDasharray="250 1005"` so a 250-unit gradient-painted dash travels the full ~1005-unit circumference per cycle. `transform: rotate(-90 180 180)` anchors the dash start at 12 o'clock. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. Verified: `animationName: maqasidPulse`, `animationDuration: 4s`.
- **Bento pillar grid replacing `.hero-modules`.** `.hero-bento` CSS grid (`repeat(4, 1fr)` desktop / `repeat(2, 1fr)` ≤768px). All 8 `MAQASID_PILLARS` rendered via map. Per-card: Lucide icon in a tinted square tile (`color-mix(... accent 12%)`), name in 0.95rem/600, Arabic root italic, **Mastery Ring** on the far right. Each card sets `--card-accent` inline from `pillar.accentColor` so hover border, box-shadow, and ring fill all derive from one canonical source. Files: `src/pages/Landing.jsx`, `src/styles/landing.css`.
- **Mastery Ring SVG (0% default).** 28px SVG, two r=12 circles. Track stroked in `var(--border)`; fill stroked in `var(--card-accent)` with `strokeDasharray={circ}` / `strokeDashoffset={circ}` where `circ = 2 * Math.PI * 12`. Dashoffset equals circumference → 0% progress. SVG root rotated `-90deg` so future non-zero progress fills from 12 o'clock. Transitions `stroke-dashoffset` over 600ms for forward-compatibility with real user data.
- **Progressive disclosure.** `.hero-bento-desc` default: `max-height: 0; opacity: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-top: 0;`. On `.hero-bento-card:hover` **or `:focus-within`**: `max-height: 140px; opacity: 1; margin-top: var(--space-2);`. Transitions 300ms (max-height, margin-top) and 200ms (opacity). `tabIndex={0}` on each card so keyboard users trigger `:focus-within` and get the same reveal — accessibility fix on top of scholar's hover-only prescription. Description text pulls from the existing `PILLAR_FEATURES[pillar.id].description` literal so no data duplication.
- **ADR filed** — `wiki/decisions/2026-04-23-landing-hero-scholar-polish-phase-2.md`.

### Deferred
- **Real Mastery Ring progress** — rings stay at 0%; this is the marketing surface, not an app view. When wired, set `strokeDashoffset` to `circ * (1 - progress)`.
- **Cormorant Garamond webfont load** — still relying on the system serif fallback.
- **Warm dark background token** (`#1a1611`) — theme-level change, not hero-scoped.
- **Touch-device description reveal** — `:focus-within` covers keyboard + tap-focus, but pure-touch flows without focus won't see descriptions. Acceptable for now; add a `tap-to-expand` toggle if surfaced.
- **Scholar audit of sections below the hero** — features, carousel, pricing, FAQ haven't been reviewed.

### Notes
- The `250 / 1005` dasharray pair is intentional: total ≈ circumference of r=160 (2π·160 ≈ 1005), so the dash "circles through" as `dashoffset` sweeps one full period. Changing the 250 to a bigger number makes the shimmer head longer.
- Stacking audit matters: without the explicit `position: relative; z-index: 1` on every hero child, the `z-index: 0` ring would still paint *above* the hero content in some Safari versions (absolute children without explicit z-index default to `auto`, which can render above `static`-flow siblings when both have non-trivial paint layers). The explicit lift is cheap insurance.
- The bento `--card-accent` pattern is the same one already used across the pillar pages post-FLO-promotion ([[2026-04-23-flo-redesign-promotion]]) — consistent canonical-accent wiring from `MAQASID_PILLARS` everywhere landing content meets pillar content.
- `preview_screenshot` succeeded this time; `preview_eval` remained the faster inspection path for animation + layout metrics.

## 2026-04-23 — Atlas Site Intelligence panel UX refit

### Context
Consulted the "Modern UI/UX Design Scholar" NotebookLM (conv `2b89f729`, note saved `1d4f6a25`) on the Atlas right-rail `SiteIntelligencePanel`. Scholar diagnosed "drawer-dump syndrome" — similar visual weight for every row, confidence vs. interpretive badges sharing the traffic-light palette, four always-"Waiting" Derived Analyses rows consuming ~120 px of dead vertical space with zero insight, and an Overall Suitability score whose provenance was unclear. Goal: a site-evaluator must answer *"is this land good?"* in under 5 seconds. Plan filed at `atlas/tasks/site-intelligence-ux-refit-plan.md`.

### Done
- **Phase 1 — Hierarchy reorder.** Moved `Derived Analyses` out of the top Bento's right column so scroll order is now **Score → Critical Alert → LIVE US/ON Data → Derived Analyses**. Raw evidence (measured layers) now precedes computed insights. File: `atlas/apps/web/src/components/panels/sections/ScoresAndFlagsSection.tsx`.
- **Phase 3 — Derived collapsed to disclosure when fully blocked.** Extracted a new `DerivedAnalysesCard` subcomponent. When every Tier-3 row is `status: 'waiting'`, the card collapses to a single header row reading *"N analyses awaiting Tier-1 data ▾"*; click expands the full dependency list. When any row is `computing` / `complete`, the card opens by default. New CSS classes `.tier3Header` / `.tier3HeaderTitle` / `.tier3Body` + `.tier3Card { overflow: hidden }` for the disclosure animation; removes the old per-card `padding` so the header owns its own 10×14 padding.
- **Phase 2 — Badge semantics split.** Added `variant?: 'neutral' | 'semantic'` prop to `ConfBadge` (`_shared.tsx`), defaulting to `'neutral'`. Confidence pills now render with new `.badgeNeutralHigh/Medium/Low` classes (monochrome grey, 1 px panel-text border, decreasing opacity) so meta-data doesn't compete with interpretive chips like *Arid*, *Hardiness 6a*, *Estimated*. The `semantic` variant preserves the old traffic-light green/gold/red for any future *interpretive* badge use. Default flip is source-wide: all ~20 `ConfBadge` call sites across `GroundwaterSection`, `CommunitySection`, `EnvironmentalRiskSection`, etc. inherit the neutral styling for free.
- **Phase 4b — Hero score liveness pulse.** New `.scoreCirclePulse::before` pseudo-element applies a 2 s single-shot gold `box-shadow` spread (0 → 10 px → 0) on mount, scoped to hero-size rings (`size > 50`) via `ScoreCircle` internal conditional class. Runs on component mount and re-mount — the key changes when score changes via its parent React tree. `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables.
- **Phases 4a / 4c / 4d — no-ops (already present).** Sticky mini-score overlap is already prevented by the existing `IntersectionObserver` in `StickyMiniScore.tsx` (`rootMargin: 0px` means the sticky only reveals when the hero card is fully out of view); idle empty-state is already rendered at `SiteIntelligencePanel.tsx:632-642` ("Draw a property boundary to fetch site data"); the suitability card already lifts above its peers via `color-mix(in oklch, var(--color-panel-card) 88%, #ffffff 12%)` + inset gold shadow.

### Verified
- `npx tsc --noEmit` in `apps/web` — exit 0, no diagnostics touching the edited files.
- Vite HMR updated `ScoresAndFlagsSection.tsx`, `_shared.tsx`, `StickyMiniScore.tsx`, `panel.module.css`, `SiteIntelligencePanel.module.css` with no console errors. Unrelated 401s from AI enrichment endpoints pre-existed this session.
- `preview_screenshot` timed out (screenshot tool unresponsive at 5200); did not substitute assumed-pass verification. Structure correctness rests on tsc + HMR. Flagged as deferred.

### Deferred
- **Actionable alert CTAs wired to real endpoints.** Blocking-flag `action.href`-based stub handler is unchanged from prior session; no new wiring this pass (scholar's Phase 1b is still TODO beyond the stub).
- **Bento side-by-side top band.** Scholar option (d) retained as `.topBento { flex-direction: column }` — the 360–400 px rail is too narrow for a 2-col bento. Revisit via container-query when panel width changes.
- **Rhythm breaks / micro-charts between deep sections.** Scholar Phase 5 unchanged — separate design sprint.
- **Pulse-on-score-change.** Current animation fires on mount / React remount. If score recomputes in place (same `key`) the `::before` does not restart. If needed, add a `key={score}` on the `ScoreCircle` wrapper at the hero call site.
- **Preview screenshot verification.** Screenshot tool was unresponsive; deferred visual confirmation to next session when data pipeline returns past the "Fetching environmental data" loading state.

### Files touched
- `apps/web/src/components/panels/sections/ScoresAndFlagsSection.tsx` — JSX reorder + new `DerivedAnalysesCard` subcomponent + `useState` import.
- `apps/web/src/components/panels/sections/_shared.tsx` — `ConfBadge` variant prop + neutral-class mapping; `ScoreCircle` applies `.scoreCirclePulse` at hero size.
- `apps/web/src/styles/panel.module.css` — `.badgeNeutralHigh/Medium/Low` definitions.
- `apps/web/src/components/panels/SiteIntelligencePanel.module.css` — `.tier3Card` overflow + new `.tier3Header/HeaderTitle/Body`; new `.scoreCirclePulse::before` keyframes + reduced-motion guard.
- `tasks/site-intelligence-ux-refit-plan.md` — new planning artifact.

### Notes
- Defaulting `ConfBadge` to `'neutral'` globally (not opt-in) is deliberate: every existing call site renders confidence as a meta-attribute of underlying data, which the scholar argued should *never* share the semantic palette. If a truly interpretive rating surface appears later, the `variant='semantic'` opt-in is ready.
- `DerivedAnalysesCard`'s auto-open when any row is non-waiting means the user is only ever presented the collapsed summary when the card has nothing to say — the failure mode of "scrolling past a collapsed card that contained a freshly-complete analysis" can't happen.
- Scholar conversation continues in `Modern UI/UX Design Scholar` notebook (`995a59d1-be39-...`) — future refinements can resume the same conversation to preserve the multi-turn context about this specific panel.

### Session Debrief
- **Completed:** Scholar consult + 4-phase implementation plan + Phases 1, 2, 3, 4b shipped; Phases 4a/c/d confirmed already in place.
- **Deferred:** Actionable alert CTAs; rhythm breaks; preview screenshot verification.
- **Recommended Next Session:** Wire blocking-flag `action` to real authority-contact / survey-upload endpoints, and complete preview verification once the site-data pipeline resolves past loading state.

## 2026-04-24 — Atlas CA Tier-3 verification (Milton, ON)
**Session type:** atlas · bugfix + verification
**Branch:** `feat/shared-scoring`
**Project:** Milton, ON — `467f8ad4-3c90-459d-881d-7d76ad62c204` (53.24 acres)

First end-to-end Tier-3 run against a Canadian site. Four latent CA-path defects surfaced and fixed:

- **CA-1** NRCan HRDEM STAC queryable: sortby field is `datetime`, not `properties.datetime`. Fix: `ElevationGridReader.ts` body.
- **CA-2** ECCC `data_period` label ("1981-2010" / "Estimated") crashed Postgres `date` binding. Fix: coerce start year → `${year}-01-01`, else null. `EcccClimateAdapter.ts`.
- **CA-3** HRDEM COGs are EPSG:3979 (NAD83(CSRS)/Canada Atlas Lambert); pixel-window math treated lon/lat as projected metres → 1-pixel nodata window → `validCount=0` → Infinity reached numeric columns as spurious "numeric field overflow". Fix: proj4 reprojection in `ElevationGridReader.readNrcanHrdem`; fail-fast on empty grid in `TerrainAnalysisProcessor`. Defensive `migrations/014_widen_terrain_numerics.sql` also applied.
- **CA-4** Writer-vs-layers race: `maybeWriteAssessmentIfTier3Complete` gated only on `data_pipeline_jobs.status='complete'`, so the microclimate job could flip to complete ~1s before the `project_layers.microclimate` row was visible on the writer's pool connection. Fix: writer now also requires the three Tier-3 derived `project_layers` rows (`microclimate`, `watershed_derived`, `soil_regeneration`) to be `fetch_status='complete'` before writing.

**Milton final scores:** overall **73.0**, 14 labels, confidence low. Terrain: elev 193.88–203.42 m (mean 200.04), TWI 4.43, TRI 0.05 m, erosion mean 0.17 / max 11.11 t/ha/yr, `source_api=nrcan_hrdem`, `confidence=high`. `verify-scoring-parity.ts` delta **0.000**, determinism PASS.

Decision: [[2026-04-24-atlas-ca-tier3-verification-crs-and-race-fixes]]

### Session Debrief
- **Completed:** CA-1/CA-2/CA-3/CA-4 diagnosed + fixed; Milton end-to-end Tier-3 green; writer/scorer parity exact.
- **Deferred:** Original PR-ready web-side changes on this branch (apps/web/* + packages/shared/*) are still uncommitted — out of scope for this session.
- **Recommended Next Session:** Repeat the verification on a second CA site (different province / more extreme terrain) to confirm the EPSG:3979 + proj4 path generalises, then merge `feat/shared-scoring` to main.

## 2026-04-24 — Atlas §7 regeneration events: API + timeline UI
**Session type:** atlas · feature
**Branch:** `feat/shared-scoring`
**Manifest item:** `regen-stage-intervention-log` · `planned → done`

Closed the remaining two layers on top of migration 015 + the shared `RegenerationEvent` Zod schema. Substrate existed; nobody could read or write. This session wired the API and UI.

- **API** — `apps/api/src/routes/regeneration-events/index.ts` ships full CRUD + filtered list at `/api/v1/projects/:id/regeneration-events`. GET accepts `eventType`, `interventionType`, `phase`, `since`, `until`, `parentId`; guards stack mirrors `routes/comments`. PostGIS round-trip via `ST_SetSRID(ST_GeomFromGeoJSON(...), 4326)` on write and `ST_AsGeoJSON(location)::jsonb` on read. PATCH handles three-way `location` semantics (undefined=keep, null=clear, value=insert). Activity log entries emitted for create/update/delete.
- **Frontend** — Zustand store `regenerationEventStore` mirrors `siteDataStore` shape (`eventsByProject[projectId] = { events, status, error }`); mutations refetch on success. `useRegenerationEventsForProject` hook is the fetch-on-mount convenience. `RegenerationTimelineCard` mounted on `EcologicalDashboard` between the interventions list and Carbon Estimate; inline `LogEventForm` uses `RegenerationEventInput.safeParse()` for client-side validation and submits via the store.
- **Convention introduced:** inline disclosure form as the dashboard-side input pattern for continuous-logging surfaces (as opposed to the wizard's one-shot intake). Documented in `apps/web/src/features/soil-ecology/CONTEXT.md` and intended for reuse before any other dashboard-level input surface is added.
- **Deferred:** media upload (`media_urls` API-populated only); polygon-`location` drawing (Point via boundary-centroid helper or NULL site-wide for now); before/after side-by-side photo compare; edit/delete from the timeline UI.

**Verification:** `tsc -b packages/shared`, `tsc -b apps/api`, and `apps/web tsc --noEmit` all clean. No API smoke test run in-session (backend behind auth + project-membership guards).

### Session Debrief
- **Completed:** API routes, store, hook, timeline card, inline log form, dashboard mount, CONTEXT.md update, manifest flip.
- **Deferred:** API smoke test against dev DB; media upload; polygon drawing; before/after compare pane; edit/delete UI; commit + push.
- **Recommended Next Session:** Ship the next planned P2 §7 item — `native-pollinator-biodiversity` has no server surface yet and benefits from the regeneration-events substrate already in place (succession observations can reuse `event_type='observation'`).

---

## 2026-04-24 — Atlas §7 pollinator habitat synthesis (dashboard-only)
**Session type:** atlas · feature
**Branch:** `feat/shared-scoring`
**Manifest item:** `native-pollinator-biodiversity` · `planned → partial`

Closed the dashboard-facing layer on `native-pollinator-biodiversity` using only already-available substrate. Scoped honestly — map overlay deferred, corridor connectivity flagged as out of reach without least-cost-path math.

- **Shared heuristic** — `packages/shared/src/ecology/pollinatorHabitat.ts` ships a pure function over `LandCoverSummary` + `WetlandsFloodSummary` returning `{ suitabilityScore, suitabilityBand, supportiveCoverPct, limitingCoverPct, canopyBand, wetlandEdgeBonus, nativePlantCategories, caveats }`. Weight tables attributed to Xerces Society / USDA NRCS CP-42 scoping for supportive classes; limiting classes penalize intensive crop + impervious with a softened multiplier (edge effects persist). Canopy 10-60% hits the edge-habitat sweet spot; wetland/riparian adds up to 25 bonus points.
- **Dashboard section** — `EcologicalDashboard` now renders "NATIVE PLANTING & POLLINATOR HABITAT" between WETLAND & RIPARIAN and ECOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: score + band chip, 4-cell metric grid, habitat-class-keyed plant-category list, honest caveat list. CSS reuses the sage/gold palette already established for the card pattern.
- **Scoring parity intentionally untouched** — the heuristic is NOT registered as a scoring component. `computeScores.ts` is not modified; `verify-scoring-parity.ts` delta stays 0.000.
- **Manifest discipline** — flipped to `partial`, not `done`. Three real gaps prevent `done`: (1) no corridor connectivity (needs least-cost-path on habitat-friction raster); (2) no region-specific native-plant lists (needs USDA PLANTS / ecoregion adapter); (3) no map overlay (needs polygonized land cover or a new pollinator-candidate-zone processor). All three documented in `apps/web/src/features/soil-ecology/CONTEXT.md`.

**Verification:** `tsc -b packages/shared` clean; `apps/web tsc --noEmit` clean (exit 0); no modifications to `apps/api` or `computeScores.ts`.

### Session Debrief
- **Completed:** Shared heuristic + dashboard section + CSS + manifest flip + CONTEXT.md documentation.
- **Deferred:** Corridor connectivity, region-specific plant lists, map overlay, GBIF adapter merge (worktree-only), commit + push.
- **Recommended Next Session:** Either (a) unblock manifest `partial → done` by picking ONE deferred item — polygonized land-cover GeoJSON would be highest-value since it unlocks both the map overlay AND better cover synthesis, OR (b) pick up `invasive-succession-mapping` since it can genuinely reuse the regeneration-events substrate via `event_type='observation'` + structured `observations` jsonb.

## 2026-04-24 — Atlas map UI: chrome palette / perimeter layout / split switcher

**Project:** OLOS (Atlas submodule)
**Objective:** Close three UI issues in the map view: biophilic palette bleeding into chrome, left-edge tool column obstructing map canvas, split-pane controls colliding with primary chrome.

### What shipped

**Chrome/palette separation (`tokens.css` + `dark-mode.css`):**
- New neutral earth-tinted chrome scale: `--color-chrome-bg (#1f1d1a)`, `--color-chrome-bg-translucent`, `--color-chrome-bg-overlay (0.72 α for map overlays)`, `--color-elevation-highlight`.
- Gold split for WCAG AA compliance on dark chrome: `--color-gold-brand (#c4a265)` for logomark only vs `--color-gold-active (#e0b56d)` for active UI controls.
- `--color-info-500 (#5b8eaf)` decoupled from water tokens so map-water semantics stay map-water.
- Dark-mode elevation lift: `--color-surface: #2a2420`, `--color-surface-raised: #342d26`.
- 28 inline `rgba(26, 22, 17, X)` strings across 17 files swept to `var(--color-chrome-bg-translucent)`. Zero visual change at call sites; one source of truth.
- Regression caught: `MapLoadingOverlay` lost its 0.72 page-dimming under the translucent token → routed to dedicated `--color-chrome-bg-overlay` instead.

**Perimeter tool layout (`MapView.tsx`, `LeftToolSpine.tsx`, `DataLayersPopover.tsx`):**
- 7-item left column → 40 px icon spine (Cross-section / Viewshed / Measure / "Layers" popover folding Historical+OSM / microclimate / windbreak / restoration / etc.).
- Top-right cluster (`ViewModeSwitcher`, `SplitScreenToggle`, `MapStyleSwitcher`) for set-and-forget view-context controls, `top:56 right:60`.
- Left-edge footprint: ~80 × 320 px → ~40 × 200 px (~60 % less obstruction).
- When split active, primary cluster's ViewMode + MapStyleSwitcher are conditionally suppressed (`!splitScreenActive && …`), leaving only Split·on toggle as an exit affordance — stops the cluster from overlapping the split pane or project title.

**Split-pane basemap switcher (`SplitScreenCompare.tsx`):**
- 5 labeled pills (~310 px wide, overflowing 276 px pane at 50 % split) → 5 Lucide icons (`Satellite` / `Mountain` / `MountainSnow` / `Map` / `Layers`) at 28 × 28 with `DelayedTooltip` (800 ms, bottom) + `aria-label`.
- `maxWidth: calc(100% - 24px)` + `flex-wrap: wrap` → graceful multi-row degradation at narrow pane widths (verified 15 %–85 % drag range: zero overflow at any ratio).
- Active state uses `rgba(224,181,109,0.22)` bg + `#e0b56d` border matching `.spine-btn[data-active="true"]` — shared signifier vocabulary with the left spine.
- **Relocated from `top:12 right:12` → `top:12 left:12` of the split pane** after the user noticed it overlapping with Redraw Boundary + stats. Root cause: `.floatingControls` lives at z-index 5 vs split pane's z-index 3, and both target the map-area's top-right corner. Anchoring to the divider side gives the switcher unambiguous ownership by the split pane; 103 px clearance from `.floatingControls` at default 50 % split.

**Divider drag selection (`SplitScreenCompare.tsx`):**
- `onMouseDown` now calls `e.preventDefault()` and sets `document.body.style.userSelect = 'none'` (plus `-webkit-` prefix). `onUp` restores both. Previously, dragging the divider highlighted sidebar labels / panel titles / legend text as the pointer crossed them.

### Verification
- `tsc --noEmit` from `apps/web`: exit 0 (ran 3× across the session — after icon conversion, after flex-wrap, after user-select fix).
- DOM-measured switcher placement across 15 %–85 % split range: always inside pane, never overlapping `.floatingControls` or `Split·on`.
- Simulated drag: `userSelect` transitions `""` → `"none"` → `""` cleanly; no selection created mid-drag.
- Scholar consult archived at `design-system/ogden-atlas/ui-ux-scholar-audit.md` (NotebookLM `995a59d1-…`).

### Session Debrief
- **Completed:** Chrome/biophilic token separation, perimeter tool layout, split-pane icon switcher, drag selection fix. Decision record filed at `wiki/decisions/2026-04-24-atlas-palette-perimeter-split-switcher.md`.
- **Deferred:**
  - OKLCH rework of 13 zone-identity polygon hues for equal perceived lightness.
  - Lifting `splitPct` from `SplitScreenCompare` local state into `mapStore` (would enable finer primary-cluster repositioning).
  - `ActiveToolChip` (center-top live-metric chip during measurement) — mentioned in perimeter plan, not implemented.
  - Map-label halo sweep for sage/water labels over satellite imagery.
- **Recommended Next Session:** Either (a) pick up ActiveToolChip since the spine perimeter plan cited it as the UX payoff of hiding tools mid-measurement, or (b) the zone-polygon OKLCH pass since the 13-color perceptual parity is the last place the biophilic palette still reads unbalanced.

## 2026-04-24 (afternoon) — MILOS scholar-led UI motif pass

**Objective:** Apply UI/UX Scholar recommendations to Prophetic Path (timeline + intro) and LevelOverviewPage (all 7 pillars), underpinned by a shared `--motif-*` token extraction.

**Consults:** `pp-consult.txt`, `pp-intro-consult.txt`, `flo-consult.txt` → NotebookLM 995a59d1. All three answers converged on the same five motifs (editorial serif, shimmer stroke, halo, ghost-text, soft-glass) being duplicated across pages.

**Phases completed:**

- **Phase 0 — Shared motif tokens** (`src/styles/tokens.css`)
  - Added `--motif-soft-glass-{bg,border,shadow}`, `--motif-ghost-opacity`, `--motif-shimmer-duration` with light + dark variants
  - Added utilities: `.motif-halo` (+`--strong`), `.motif-ghost-text`, `.motif-soft-glass`, `.motif-shimmer-border`
  - `@keyframes motifShimmerStroke` + `prefers-reduced-motion` gating
  - Fallback chain: `var(--motif-tint, var(--level-color, var(--pillar-accent, var(--primary))))`

- **Phase 1 — pp-intro rewrite** (`PropheticPath.{jsx,css}`)
  - 3-line editorial header: eyebrow (city, 0.65rem uppercase +0.1em), hero (active node title, Noto Serif 2rem / weight 400 / kerning −0.025em), subline (Fajr/Maghrib bookends)
  - Capped `.pp-intro` at `max-height: 180px`; preserved niyyah-echo below
  - Consumes existing `cityName` + `timings` from `usePrayerTimes`

- **Phase 2 — FLO refactor** (`LevelOverviewPage.{jsx,css}`)
  - Wheel wrapped in `.flo__section--wheel.motif-soft-glass.motif-shimmer-border`
  - `.flo__grid--has-progress` parent class toggles comparative ghosting (Q4 trap fix)
  - `.flo::after` blurred pillar-tinted aura top-left (360×360, radial gradient, z-index −1 with `.flo > * { z-index: 1 }`)
  - `.flo__section` top-rule in `color-mix(var(--pillar-accent) 40%)`
  - 6/7 pillar overview routes smoke-tested — all correctly express pillar ambient while tier dominance holds

- **Phase 3 — Prophetic Path timeline** (`PropheticPath.css`)
  - Chose **Progressive Disclosure vertical** pattern (user pick from 3 options)
  - Active card: `--motif-soft-glass-bg` + padding:2rem + Noto Serif 2.5rem @ weight 400 + `::before` shimmer ring (mask-composite xor, 4s linear)
  - Superseded earlier active-title `font-weight: 600` / `letter-spacing: -0.01em` in favor of size+air hierarchy
  - Past/upcoming + next semi-expanded rules already in place; no structural changes needed

**Verification:**
- `npm run build` ✓ (1.90s)
- `npm run lint`: no new errors in touched files (pre-existing 625-error backlog unchanged)
- Preview verified at 1400×900 desktop + 390×844 mobile; eval confirmed: active card Noto Serif 40px weight 400 letter-spacing −1px, shimmer anim `pp-active-shimmer` 4s, 8-card spine state sequence `active → next → 4×upcoming → 2×past`

**Decision record:** `wiki/decisions/2026-04-24-milos-ui-motif-tokens.md`

### Session Debrief
- **Completed:** All 5 plan phases + build + decision record. `--motif-*` tokens live, FLO wheel framed with soft-glass + shimmer, PP active card carries editorial serif + shimmer border, pp-intro bookends render, comparative ghosting replaces absolute ghosting.
- **Deferred:**
  - Full 7/7 pillar smoke-test (ummah gated by unrelated CeremonyGuard opening threshold — pre-existing, not a regression)
  - Light-mode explicit preview verification (Vite prefers-color-scheme override didn't flip the app's internal theme; styling deemed correct from token structure)
  - Broader lint cleanup (625 pre-existing errors are their own session)
- **Recommended next session:** Either (a) tackle the lint backlog as a focused sweep, or (b) write `wiki/concepts/motif-tokens.md` so the 4th page that picks up these motifs composes rather than duplicates.

## 2026-04-24 — TaskDetailPanel UI/UX scholar refit (Shahada modal)

**Trigger:** User pasted Shahada — Core modal screenshot, requested `/notebooklm` UI/UX Scholar consult. Five Q's sent to NotebookLM `995a59d1`; all 5 answers approved into Session Execution Plan; user typed "approved".

**Changes — `src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.{jsx,css}`:**
- **Q1 (title weight):** `.tdp-title` → Noto Serif 2rem / weight 400 / letter-spacing −0.025em / line-height 1.15. Mobile bumped 1.25→1.5rem.
- **Q2 (priority placement):** New `.tdp-header-block` flex column reorders title → priority pill → description; pill desaturated to `color-mix(... 12%, transparent)` and reduced to 3px×10px / 10px text / 0.08em tracking.
- **Q3 (tier repetition):** `tierSet` rollup in JSX — homogeneous-tier subtask lists hoist a single `AmanahTierBadge` into `.tdp-section-label__tier` slot; per-row badges gated by `!sharedTier`. Mixed-tier lists unchanged.
- **Q4 (Done button loop):** `data-state` attribute (`empty`/`locked`/`ready`) replaces `disabled`. Ghost default (1.5px hairline accent, transparent bg). At `ready`, button fills with accent + sets `--motif-tint` + composes `.motif-shimmer-border` (earned-completion shimmer). Click guarded by `if (!isReady) return`.
- **Q5 (description recede):** `.tdp-description-text` color via `color-mix(in srgb, var(--text) calc(var(--motif-ghost-variant-opacity, 0.7) * 100%), transparent)` — naked text, no container. Caught a unit-coercion bug: bare `var(--motif-ghost-variant-opacity, 65%)` was producing fully-opaque text because the token resolves to `0.7` (unitless) not `70%`; `calc(... * 100%)` fixes.

**Verification:**
- `npm run build` ✓
- Preview eval at `/app/faith-shahada` → opened TaskDetailPanel for "Study the meaning…": confirmed title=Noto Serif 32px/400/−0.8px, priority=10px/700/0.8px, sectionLabelHasTier=true, btnState=`locked` & btnBg=transparent (ghost), desc color resolved to `color(srgb 0.10 0.11 0.13 / 0.7)` after fix.
- Screenshot tool timed out (renderer stuck on modal); state-eval verification accepted in lieu.

**Decision record:** `wiki/decisions/2026-04-24-task-detail-panel-scholar-refit.md`

### Session Debrief
- **Completed:** All 5 scholar Q's applied to TaskDetailPanel; build clean; live preview verified via computed-style eval; decision record + log entry filed; one CSS-coercion bug caught and fixed.
- **Deferred:** Visual screenshot (preview_screenshot timed out on the open modal — eval-based verification used instead). `InlineTaskDetail` not yet refactored to match — flagged as follow-on.
- **Recommended next session:** Apply the same header-block / tier-rollup / ghost-button pattern to `InlineTaskDetail` so all task-modal surfaces share the new vocabulary.

## 2026-04-24 — InlineTaskDetail follow-on (vocabulary alignment)

**Trigger:** Carry the TaskDetailPanel scholar-refit pattern to its sibling component so both task-modal surfaces share vocabulary.

**Changes — `src/components/work/InlineTaskDetail.{jsx,css}`:**
- **Q1 (editorial title):** `.iltd__title` → Noto Serif 1.75rem / weight 400 / −0.025em / line-height 1.15 (was var(--text-lg) / 700 / −0.02em / 1.3). Slightly smaller than TaskDetailPanel's 2rem because iltd is an inline-expanded card, not a modal — the smaller size respects the surrounding grid density.
- **Q3 (tier rollup):** Imported `AmanahTierBadge`. Added `tierSet`/`sharedTier` rollup. New `.iltd__section-label__tier` slot inside Subtasks header hosts a single badge when homogeneous; per-row `.iltd__subtask-tier` gated by `!sharedTier` for mixed-tier sets. Section-label is now `inline-flex` with 8px gap to seat the badge.
- **Q5 (description recede):** `.iltd__description` color now uses the same `color-mix(in srgb, var(--text) calc(var(--motif-ghost-variant-opacity, 0.7) * 100%), transparent)` formula as TaskDetailPanel.

**Skipped (intentionally):**
- **Q2 (priority demoted):** N/A — InlineTaskDetail's priority is an *editable select* in the controls grid, not a display pill. Demotion would conflict with the editing semantics.
- **Q4 (ghost Done button):** N/A — InlineTaskDetail has no Done button; status changes via select.

**Verification:**
- `npm run build` ✓ (1.64s)
- AmanahTierBadge import path resolves
- Live preview verification skipped: couldn't reach a `PillarLevelDashboard` view with an active inline-selected task from current preview navigation state. Pattern mirrors already-verified TaskDetailPanel; risk of visual regression low.

### Session Debrief
- **Completed:** InlineTaskDetail aligned to shared vocabulary (Q1, Q3, Q5 applied; Q2/Q4 documented as intentionally skipped).
- **Deferred:** Live preview verification (component out of reach without project-board setup).
- **Recommended next session:** Either (a) audit any remaining task-display surfaces (e.g., `BbosTaskPanel`, modal flows in `KanbanBoard`) for the same vocabulary alignment, or (b) push the lint backlog sweep.

## 2026-04-25 — Audit: BbosTaskPanel + KanbanBoard vocabulary alignment

**Trigger:** Final follow-on from TaskDetailPanel scholar refit — audit remaining task-display surfaces for the same shared vocabulary.

**Audit results:**

| Surface | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `KanbanBoard.{jsx,css}` | No own modal — delegates `onSelectTask` to parent (which mounts TaskDetailPanel). No work needed. |
| `BbosTaskPanel.{jsx,css}` | Q1 (editorial title) + Q5 (purpose recede) apply. Q2/Q3/Q4 do not — explained below. |

**Why Q2/Q3/Q4 don't apply to BbosTaskPanel:**
- **Q2 (priority demote):** No priority pill. Stage badge + editable status select sit above title; both are intentionally interactive/anchoring, not display-only.
- **Q3 (tier rollup):** BBOS tasks carry `stage`/`subLevel`, not `tier`. Different domain vocabulary.
- **Q4 (ghost Done):** Done button isn't gated by progress — it's a validation gate (all defined fields must have content). The current `btp-done-btn--shake` on validation failure is already a scholar-friendly "never looks broken" signal. Always-filled accent style fits the always-actionable semantics.

**Changes — `src/components/bbos/BbosTaskPanel.css`:**
- **Q1 (`.btp-title`):** `2rem / weight 400 / Noto Serif / -0.025em / line-height 1.15` (was `1.875rem / 800 / font-heading / 1.2`).
- **Q5 (`.btp-purpose-text`):** color now `color-mix(in srgb, var(--text) calc(var(--motif-ghost-variant-opacity, 0.7) * 100%), transparent)` (was `var(--text2)`). Aligns the purpose paragraph with the same recede formula used in TaskDetailPanel and InlineTaskDetail.

**Verification:**
- `npm run build` ✓ (1.50s)
- Live preview verification skipped: BBOS section in preview has no seeded tasks, so panel can't be reached. CSS is isolated to two selectors and mirrors already-verified pattern.

### Session Debrief
- **Completed:** Audit of KanbanBoard + BbosTaskPanel; Q1+Q5 applied to BbosTaskPanel where applicable; Q2/Q3/Q4 documented as intentionally skipped due to BBOS architectural differences.
- **Deferred:** Live preview verification (no seeded BBOS tasks in current dev state).
- **Recommended next session:** Lint backlog sweep, or audit any other modal-style surfaces (e.g., `ProjectSlideUp`, `SubmoduleSlideUp`) that may carry display title + description pairs.


## 2026-04-25 — Marketing site hero alignment: BBOS + MILOS

**Trigger:** User request to give BBOS and MILOS landing-page heroes the same tonal energy as OLOS ("See the land for what it truly is — before you commit to it.") and MTC ("A place to stand on earth and remember why it matters.") — short forward-statement headlines with verb/noun-led clause, em-dash break, and italic key word at the end.

**Pattern observed across siblings (OLOS / MTC):**
- Hero order: `.hero-ayah` → `.hero-eyebrow` → `.hero-headline` → `.hero-sub` → `.hero-rule` → `.pathways`
- Eyebrow uses glyph + middot pattern: `◯ · OLOS · Land Design Intelligence · Functional Prototype` / `◞ · MTC · Faith · Land · Creation · Ontario`
- Headline is a single forward statement, em-dash break, italic key word at end

**Changes — `website/bbos/index.html` (lines 215–232):**
- Reordered: `.hero-ayah` now precedes `.hero-eyebrow` (was inverted).
- Eyebrow: `Barakah Business Operating System` → `◈ · BBOS · Barakah Business Operating System · Live`.
- Headline: `This is what that forgetting looks like in the ordinary life of *a man building a business.*` → `Build the business — without disappearing *inside* it.` (Candidate B / threshold-warning, OLOS-flavored — verb-led, names what BBOS protects against).
- Subhead: kept verbatim (5-sentence narrative) per user preference after considering a tightened 2-sentence variant.
- Ayah unchanged (Surah Al-Hashr 59:19).

**Changes — `website/milos/index.html` (lines 222–236):**
- Removed standalone `<p class="hero-symbol">◊</p>` element; folded the lozenge glyph into the eyebrow line. Orphaned `.hero-symbol` CSS rule (line 64) left in place — harmless dead style.
- Reordered: `.hero-ayah` now precedes `.hero-eyebrow`.
- Eyebrow: `Islamic Life Operating System` → `◊ · MILOS · Islamic Life Operating System · In Development`.
- Headline: `Your life is not seven separate problems. It is *one trust — with seven dimensions.*` → `A way to organize your whole life — as the trust *it always was.*` (negation-correction → forward statement; iterated through three tweaks: "tend the whole of your life" → "tend your whole life" → "organize your whole life").
- Subhead: `Faith, life, intellect, family, wealth, environment, and ummah — the seven Maqasid al-Shariah. Not a productivity system. Not a habit tracker. An operating system…` → `Faith, life, intellect, family, wealth, environment, and community — the seven higher objectives of Islamic law. One operating system to help you see what your life is putting forth for tomorrow.` (drops the double-negation that echoed the old headline; "ummah" → "community" for plain-English clarity; "Maqasid al-Shariah" → "higher objectives of Islamic law"; lifts the Al-Hashr 59:18 ayah's image — "what your life is putting forth for tomorrow" — into the body copy).
- Ayah unchanged (Surah Al-Hashr 59:18).

**Verification:**
- DOM read of served HTML at each step confirmed every edit applied correctly (`hero-ayah → hero-eyebrow → hero-headline → hero-sub` order, eyebrow glyph + middot pattern present, em italics on headline key word, subhead text exact).
- `preview_screenshot` was unresponsive throughout the session (timed out at 30s on every attempt; one final "target closed" error). Visual verification deferred — user can confirm by loading `http://localhost:8080/bbos/` and `http://localhost:8080/milos/` after restarting the static preview server.
- No CSS changes; all hero classes shared and already proven on OLOS/MTC.
- Pure static HTML — no build, lint, or test step applies.

### Session Debrief
- **Completed:** BBOS hero tonal alignment (eyebrow + ordering + headline) with original 5-sentence subhead preserved per user preference. MILOS hero full alignment (eyebrow glyph + ordering + headline + subhead) with three iterative headline refinements and a user-authored subhead variant.
- **Deferred:** Visual screenshot verification (preview tool unresponsive). Side-by-side screenshot comparison of BBOS / OLOS / MTC / MILOS heroes.
- **Recommended next session:** (a) Apply the same eyebrow glyph + middot pattern to the Ogden Hub home page (`website/index.html`) if it lacks it, for full family consistency. (b) Visual QA pass on all four product heroes at desktop + mobile widths once the preview renderer is healthy. (c) Consider whether the marketing-site sub-pages (`/bbos/solution/`, `/mtc/collective/solution/`, `/olos/solution/`) need the same hero treatment.


## 2026-04-25 — OGDEN Hub home eyebrow + product glyph audit

**Trigger:** Follow-on from same-day BBOS/MILOS hero alignment (commit `96dbc48`). Home page (`website/index.html`) lacked the family eyebrow pattern; glyph audit surfaced two product-card vs product-page mismatches.

**Changes:**

- **`website/index.html` line 227** — Home hero eyebrow: `Structured Service · Rooted Intention` → `◆ · OGDEN · Structured Service · Rooted Intention` (full family pattern: glyph + name slot + descriptor pair). Glyph `&#9670;` (◆ U+25C6 Black Diamond) — distinct from the four product glyphs (◤ ○ ◈ ◇), reads as the umbrella shape.
- **`website/index.html` line 383** — BBOS product card badge: `&#8297;&#10689;` (Left-to-Right Isolate U+2069 + ◈ U+29C1) → `&#9672;` (◈ U+25C8). Drops the bidirectional control char (was likely an accidental editor artifact); aligns home-card glyph with the BBOS product-page eyebrow which already uses U+25C8.
- **`website/milos/index.html` line 228** — MILOS hero eyebrow glyph: `&loz;` (◊ U+25CA Lozenge, filled) → `&#9671;` (◇ U+25C7 White Diamond, open). Aligns the product page with the home card, which already uses the open ◇. Open/hairline diamond pairs better with OLOS's open ○ in the family treatment.

**Canonical glyphs (now consistent across home cards + product page eyebrows):**
| Product | Canonical glyph (codepoint) |
|---|---|
| OGDEN umbrella | ◆ U+25C6 (9670) |
| MTC | ◤ U+25E4 (9700) |
| OLOS | ○ U+25CB (9675) |
| BBOS | ◈ U+25C8 (9672) |
| MILOS | ◇ U+25C7 (9671) |

**Verification (DOM + layout via `preview_inspect`):**
- All three edits confirmed live in served HTML.
- All five hero blocks (`/`, `/bbos/`, `/olos/`, `/mtc/`, `/milos/`) verified at three viewports (1440 desktop, 768 tablet, 375 mobile):
  - Hero child ordering: `hero-ayah/hadith → hero-eyebrow → hero-headline → hero-sub` ✓
  - Headline `<em>` italics computed-style `italic` (inside / commit / why it matters. / it always was.) ✓
  - All eyebrow glyph codepoints render as intended (no tofu / replacement boxes).
  - No horizontal overflow at any viewport.
  - Home eyebrow wraps to 3 lines at 375px mobile (consistent with MILOS sibling), 1 line at 768/1440.
- All four home product card badges render their canonical glyphs (◤ ○ ◈ ◇).

**QA gap (deferred):** `preview_screenshot` was unresponsive across both 2026-04-25 sessions — every call timed out at 30s. DOM/layout inspection covered content, structure, computed styles, dimensions, and overflow, but no rendered-pixel verification was possible. User can confirm visually at `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Session Debrief
- **Completed:** Home page family eyebrow alignment; BBOS + MILOS canonical glyph fix-up; full DOM + layout QA across 5 pages × 3 viewports; new `feedback_bbos_subhead_protected` memory written (5-sentence subhead is canonical, do not tighten).
- **Deferred:** Visual screenshot QA (preview tool unresponsive — environment issue, not code). Graphify regeneration (`/graphify --update website` per `website/CONTEXT.md`).
- **Recommended next session:** (a) Investigate why `preview_screenshot` keeps timing out on this Windows env. (b) Consider whether `/solution/` sub-pages need parallel hero/eyebrow treatment. (c) Run `/graphify --update website` to refresh the website knowledge graph.


## 2026-04-25 — MILOS pre-test audit Phase A (Tier-1 fixes)

**Trigger:** Yousef requested a comprehensive pre-test scan to surface friction (workflow / architecture / UI) and content gaps (missing references / inconsistencies) before the next live click-through pass. Three Explore agents fanned out across the codebase; findings triaged into four severity tiers. Phase A targeted Tier-1: items that would visibly break the live test.

**Plan reference:** `C:/Users/MY OWN AXIS/.claude/plans/concurrent-nibbling-rabbit.md`

**Audit corrections (findings verified incorrect during execution):**
- T1.1 — claimed Moontrance `MODULE_ATTRS` missing → actually present at [src/data/islamic/islamic-data.js:3914,4029,4144](src/data/islamic/islamic-data.js). Each entry has full attrs/dua/closingDua/readiness/reflection. `getModuleData()` at line 6134 resolves them correctly. **Real gap:** no top-level `moontrance:` pillar key (deferred to Phase B authoring with NotebookLM grounding).
- T1.4 — claimed `toastStore.js` an orphan → actually 10 callers; distinct from `toast-store.js` (11 callers) by purpose (pillar-pulse vs operation toast).

**Changes:**
- **A.2 — CeremonyGuard wrapping** ([src/App.jsx:225-233](src/App.jsx)). Wrapped `pillar/faith` through `pillar/environment` in `<CeremonyGuard moduleId="{name}-core" isLevel1>`, `pillar/ummah` in `<CeremonyGuard moduleId="ummah">`, and the `pillar/:pillarId` catch-all in `<CeremonyGuardDynamic paramKey="pillarId">`. `pillar/moontrance` left unguarded pending top-level entry.
- **A.3 — Storage + migration error logging** ([src/services/storage.js](src/services/storage.js), [src/services/migration.js](src/services/migration.js)). Replaced silent `catch {}` blocks in `safeGet`, `safeGetJSON`, `safeRemove`, `createBackup`, `restoreBackup`, migration `read`/`write` with `console.warn(…)`. Backup create/restore failures and migration write failures additionally dispatch `bbiz:storage-error` so the existing banner surfaces them.
- **A.4 — Toast store documentation** ([src/store/toastStore.js](src/store/toastStore.js), [src/store/toast-store.js](src/store/toast-store.js)). Added cross-referencing docstring headers explaining the intentional purpose split. No deletion.
- **A.5 — Onboarding niyyah seed** ([src/pages/Onboarding.jsx](src/pages/Onboarding.jsx)). `finish()` now seeds today's niyyah from onboarding pillar+submodule selections via `completeNiyyah(...)`, or marks the day skipped via `skipNiyyah()` if user finished without selecting. User no longer hits a second ceremony immediately on first dashboard visit.

**Decision record:** [[2026-04-25-milos-pre-test-tier-1-fixes]]

**Verification:**
- `npm run build` exit 0; 2764 modules transformed; only pre-existing chunk-size warning.
- `pillar/test-unknown-id` → CeremonyGate renders (CeremonyGuardDynamic confirmed).
- `pillar/wealth` with `disable_l1_threshold_gate=false` → CeremonyGate renders for `wealth-core` moduleId.
- `pillar/wealth` with default L1 disabled → page renders directly (matches `/app/wealth-core` behavior, by design — L1 gate is opt-in).
- No console errors during navigation tests.
- `preview_screenshot` unresponsive (continuing pattern from prior 2026-04-25 sessions); eval-based verification accepted.

### Session Debrief — Phase A
- **Completed:** A.1 verification, A.2 CeremonyGuard wrapping (8 thick + 1 catch-all routes), A.3 storage/migration error logging, A.4 toast-store documentation, A.5 onboarding niyyah seed. Build clean. Two audit findings corrected as inaccurate.
- **Deferred:** Top-level `moontrance` MODULE_ATTRS entry (needs NotebookLM Muslim Scholar grounding — filed for Phase B). Pillar/moontrance ceremony gating (blocked on the same).
- **Pages touched:** [[milos]] (current state ↦ Phase A complete), this log entry, [[2026-04-25-milos-pre-test-tier-1-fixes]] decision record.
- **Recommended next:** Phase B per the approved plan — B.1 populate pillar-wisdom + next-actions (20 sub-modules, NotebookLM pass), B.2 Ummah seed-task citation backfill, B.3 Prophetic Path route graduation, B.4 Suspense + prayer-time UX fallbacks, B.5 storage quota + LevelNavigator chunk split.
