## [2026-04-16] feat | V3.2 adab refactor — contextual gates; trust banner; reviewer brief

### What was done
- **Adab correction (critical)**: refactored `AYAH_BLACKLIST` (30 entries) and `HADITH_BLACKLIST` (26 entries) in `scripts/rerank-hadith-embeddings.mjs` into `AYAH_CONTEXTUAL_GATES` / `HADITH_CONTEXTUAL_GATES`. Every authentic ayah and Sahih hadith is revelation; global vetoes are an adab violation. Gates now affirm each citation's true topical subject via keyword lists — a citation passes on subtasks whose title matches the topic, without ever declaring the revelation itself problematic. Re-score produced 289 blocks (vs 287 with blacklists — coverage effectively unchanged).
- **Scholar-lens review** of 322 blocks: identified gold-standard exemplars (Muhabbah 3:31, Ayat al-Dayn, Surah Al-Ma'un, Shu'ayb's daughter on hiring), 22 critical errors (e.g., 2:258 Nimrud debate mis-paired with Ibrahim's sacrifice), paradise/eschatology false-positive cluster, and fiqh leak (2:235 iddah verse unguarded). Document: `stages/hadith-scholar-review-review.md`.
- **UI trust banner split** in `src/components/work/TaskDetailPanel.jsx`: amber "Suggestive reference — pending scholar review" banner by default, green "Scholar-reviewed" affirmation when `activeSubtask.sourcesTrust === 'scholar-reviewed'`.
- **External reviewer brief** drafted at `stages/scholar-reviewer-brief-review.md`: defines ~10-hour engagement for 289 blocks at ~30 blocks/hr, verdict taxonomy (approve/reject/revise/defer), and reviewer scope (pairing fit, not ijazah or fatwa).
- **Feedback memory** persisted: never globally veto authentic revelation; use contextual pairing gates instead. `memory/feedback_no_blacklist_revelation.md`.

### Commits
- `b85b821` — refactor blacklists to contextual gates
- `282d65e` — feat(sources): trust banner in sources view
- `9371db2` — docs(sources): scholar reviewer brief + internal review

### Deferred
- Visual preview verification of the trust banner inside an open subtask sources panel.
- Outreach to a qualified reviewer.
- Per-pillar coverage-vs-quality audit across the 289 retained blocks.

## [2026-04-16] feat | Sources parity — 1829/1829 subtasks with Quran/hadith references

### What was done
- Achieved 100% `sources` field coverage across all 7 seed files (1,829 subtasks total).
- Baseline was ~16% coverage (289 of 1,829 subtasks had sources from prior V3/V3.1 enrichment).
- Built 3-stage pipeline: extract-missing-sources manifest → parallel agent generation → title-matching injection.
- Dispatched 18 sub-agents across 3 rounds (R1: 8 agents / 693 entries, R2: 9 agents / 885 entries, R3: 1 agent / 23 entries).
- Agents used quran.ai MCP server for canonical Arabic text (ar-simple-clean + en-sahih-international editions).
- Wrote `inject-sources-v2.mjs` with unicode-escape-aware title matching to handle `\u2014` (em dash) and `\u02bf` (ʿ) in file text.
- +15,202 lines added across 7 files. Build passes clean.

### Coverage
| Pillar | Subtasks | Sources |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Faith | 212 | 212 |
| Life | 236 | 236 |
| Intellect | 236 | 236 |
| Family | 233 | 233 |
| Wealth | 236 | 236 |
| Environment | 226 | 226 |
| Ummah | 450 | 450 |

### Commit
- `7de6a98` — feat(sources): add Quran/hadith sources to all 1829 subtasks across 7 pillars

### Next steps
- Scholar review pass on the ~1,540 newly generated sources (prior V3.1 review covered only 322 blocks).
- Consider code-splitting seed files (Vite warns >500KB chunks).

## [2026-04-16] feat | Hadith enrichment V3.1 — scholar review pass; expanded blacklists and fiqh gate

### What was done
- Acted as Islamic studies reviewer on all 322 V3 sourced blocks (full read of faith + ummah, sampled wealth/intellect/environment).
- Identified gold-standard citations (e.g., 28:26 Shu'ayb's daughter on hiring, 2:282 ayat al-dayn on debt docs, 4:35 arbitrator on mediation, 107:7 Ma'un on neighbor aid, 9:35 on kanz).
- Flagged 1 critical attribution error: 2:258 (Nimrud debate) cited for Ibrahim's sacrifice (correct: 37:102-107).
- Flagged 1 fiqh leak: 2:235 (iddah marriage-proposal) on wealth/contract subtask — was unguarded.
- Identified systemic pattern: paradise/eschatology verses (55, 56, 76, 88) pulled toward worldly subtasks via concrete-noun matches.
- Extended `FIQH_SENSITIVE_AYAHS` +13 verses with per-ayah keyword gates.
- Extended `AYAH_BLACKLIST` +30 entries, `HADITH_BLACKLIST` +14 entries.
- Re-scored and re-applied: 322 → 287 sourced blocks at higher per-citation quality.
- Review document at `stages/hadith-scholar-review-review.md`.

### Commit
- `ec6d76d` — feat(hadith): v3.1 scholar-reviewed — expanded blacklists, fiqh set, rewrote

## [2026-04-16] feat | Hadith enrichment V3 — semantic reranker (sentence-transformer embeddings) replaces lexical scoring

### What was done
- Replaced `rerank-hadith-candidates.mjs` (lexical) path with new `rerank-hadith-embeddings.mjs` using `Xenova/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` (quantized, 384-dim).
- Added `strip-hadith-sources.mjs` helper for clean re-apply cycles.
- Fixed quoted-key regex bug in `apply-hadith-sources.mjs` that was skipping all 216 moontrance blocks.
- Layered safety filters as post-embedding vetoes:
  - Per-ayah fiqh gate (iddah/divorce/dhihar verses only pass when subtask title contains topical trigger words)
  - Hadith blacklist (12 recurring FPs) + ayah blacklist (20 lexical false-friends)
  - Short-title threshold bump (≤5 words → 0.50, else 0.45)
  - Domain clash filter retained from V2
- Coverage: 1,826 blocks → 322 sourced (17.6%). Per-citation quality ~60% strong (from ~40% V1 baseline).
- QA audits at `stages/hadith-qa-audit-{review,v2-review}.md`; V3 decision at `wiki/decisions/2026-04-16-hadith-semantic-reranker.md`.

### Commit
- `2c36ce6` — feat(hadith): v3 semantic reranker — embeddings + fiqh/blacklist filters

## [2026-04-16] refactor | CeremonyGuard Phase 2d — dynamic guard for ModulePlaceholder + static wrap for Project; refactor initiative CLOSED

- **New component** `src/components/islamic/CeremonyGuardDynamic.jsx` — param-driven sibling that reads `moduleId` from `useParams(paramKey)` (default `'moduleId'`). Keeps the prop-driven `CeremonyGuard` primitive pure (decision Q1 → option b). Same threshold-store subscription + `CeremonyGate` render; DEV-only warn on missing param.
- **App.jsx wiring**: `/app/:moduleId` catch-all wrapped in `<CeremonyGuardDynamic>`; `/app/work/:projectId` wrapped in static `<CeremonyGuard moduleId="work">`. Audit revealed Project gated a hard-coded `"work"` literal — no dynamic resolution needed (decision Q2 → option i: preserve "work" gate, matches Phase 2a option-a contract for embedded tabs). Nested `Outlet`-based children (`people`, `tasks`, `money`, `assets`, `office`, `tech`, `journal`) still render through Project's `<Outlet />` after the gate passes — no per-child wrap needed.
- **Pages stripped**: `ModulePlaceholder.jsx` and `Project.jsx` — removed `useThresholdStore` + `CeremonyGate` imports, subscription, and in-body gate return. Not-found branches and all other logic preserved intact.
- **Dead-code deletion**: `src/pages/ComingSoon.jsx` removed (unimported in live src — only doc references existed). Parallel to `FivePillars.jsx` deletion in Phase 2c-sources. `src/pages/CONTEXT.md` updated.
- **Stretch rejected (decision Q3 → decline)**: Lifting the 3 `SourcesPage` tab gates via a `searchParams`-driven guard is **technically blocked**, not just out of scope. `SourcesPage` holds `activeTab` in local React state set by button `onClick` — clicking a tab does NOT update the URL. A guard above `SourcesPage` reading `searchParams.get('tab')` cannot gate what the user sees. Per-tab in-body pattern is structurally load-bearing AND matches the Phase 2c-sources semantic intent (distinct openings for Quran/Hadith/Knowledge). Permanently retained.
- **Docs**: `src/components/islamic/CONTEXT.md` rewritten — architecture section now documents three modes (route-level static, route-level dynamic, in-body-by-design). `CeremonyGuard.jsx` header comment trimmed to the intentional Sources-tab case. Decision doc `2026-04-16-ceremony-guard-route-level.md` marks Phase 2d complete.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (2530 modules, 2.04s). Preview cleared `bbiz_thr_open` and confirmed:
  - `/app/fake-module-xyz` → CeremonyGate via dynamic guard ("Fake — Module — Xyz" title rendered by PillarHeader above).
  - `/app/work/faith_core` (unopened work) → CeremonyGate.
  - `/app/work/faith_core/money` (after setting `completedOpening.work = ISO`) → Money embedded UI renders with Dashboard/Income/Expenses/Accounts, **no per-module "money" gate** (CRITICAL Phase 2a option-a regression check — passed). Screenshot captured.
  - `/app/fake-module-xyz` (after setting flag) → ModulePlaceholder renders "Module not found" (expected — gate then not-found; matches pre-refactor order).
  - `/app/work/faith_core` (after opening) → ProjectBoard pipeline renders.
- **Refactor initiative CLOSED**. Final state: `CeremonyGuard` wraps all 38+ thin/homogeneous module routes statically; `CeremonyGuardDynamic` wraps the `:moduleId` catch-all. Only remaining in-body gates are the 3 Sources tabs (`QuranPage`, `HadithPage`, `IslamicKnowledgePage`) — intentional, per-tab semantics, not URL-driven.
- **Graphify verification (post-refactor re-run on `src/`)**: `threshold_store` importers dropped from 93 (2026-04-11 baseline) to **13** (~86% reduction). All 13 remaining importers are correct-by-design: 6 ceremony primitives (`CeremonyGate`, `CeremonyGuard`, `CeremonyGuardDynamic`, `IslamicPanel`, `NiyyahAct`, `ThresholdModal`), 2 app-level (`AppShell`, `MobileNav`), 2 dashboard (`Dashboard`, `TodayFocusSection`), and the 3 intentional Sources tabs. No strays. Graph now 921 nodes / 853 edges / 209 communities; `threshold-store` betweenness dropped from 0.133 → ~0 (the module file node itself has degree 0 under path-id resolution; the shortname alias `threshold_store` carries the 13 import edges). `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` + `graph.json` refreshed.

## [2026-04-16] refactor | CeremonyGuard Phase 2c-sources — closed as no-op + FivePillars dead-code deletion

- **Discovery**: the "sources cluster" from the Phase 2a deferral list (`FivePillars`, `HadithPage`, `IslamicKnowledgePage`, `QuranPage`) was mis-grouped. Actual state: only `SourcesPage` is routed at `/app/sources`; `QuranPage`, `HadithPage`, `IslamicKnowledgePage` are **tab content** inside `SourcesPage`, each gating independently as `"quran"`, `"hadith"`, `"islamic-knowledge"`. `FivePillars.jsx` was dead code — not imported anywhere in live src (only its CSS is imported by `OverviewCards.jsx`).
- **Decision: option (B)** — do NOT lift the 3 tab-content gates. Per-tab gating is the intended semantic (distinct openings for Quran/Hadith/Knowledge), not a wiring accident. Lifting would either (A) collapse them into one gate (behavior change) or (C) require a dynamic-moduleId guard reading `searchParams` — same category as the deferred `ModulePlaceholder`/`ComingSoon` dynamic cases, better handled in a single future pass.
- **Cleanup**: deleted `src/pages/islamic/FivePillars.jsx` (unimported). Retained `FivePillars.css` — still used by `OverviewCards.jsx`. Updated `CeremonyGuard.jsx` header comment to list the actual remaining in-body gates (Project, ModulePlaceholder/ComingSoon, and the intentional Sources tab trio).
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (1.64s). No preview check needed — a comment edit + deletion of an unimported file are not browser-observable.
- **Docs**: decision doc updated — Phase 2c-sources marked closed as no-op + cleanup, rationale recorded; remaining deferred scope renamed Phase 2d (dynamic + route-id-mismatch, 3 pages total).

## [2026-04-16] refactor | CeremonyGuard Phase 2b-ummah — lift gating for 4 ummah pages

- **App.jsx**: 4 ummah standalone routes (`/app/family`, `/app/neighbors`, `/app/community`, `/app/collective`) wrapped in `<CeremonyGuard moduleId="...">`. No embedded variants to reconcile — none of the 4 appear as children of other routes.
- **4 page files stripped**: `FamilyPage.jsx`, `Neighbors.jsx`, `Community.jsx`, `CollectivePage.jsx` — removed `useThresholdStore` + `CeremonyGate` imports, `hasCompletedOpening` subscription, and in-body gate return. `useState`, `useAyahBanner`, and `<Office embedded />` (in FamilyPage only) left untouched.
- **Behavior-change accepted**: `useAyahBanner('ummah_*')` previously ran before the gate's early return, so the global ayah banner was populated while the user sat on the CeremonyGate. Post-lift the page doesn't mount while gated, so the banner stays cleared until the user passes the gate. Accepted as a latent-bug fix — banner-for-unopened-module leaked module-specific UI into the gated state.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (2529 modules, 1.55s). Preview: cleared `bbiz_thr_open`, confirmed all 4 ummah routes show CeremonyGate. Set all 4 `completedOpening` flags → confirmed all 4 render their content (Family with Overview/Office tabs + Nikāḥ ayah, Neighbors, Community with Ummah framework, Collective with Khilāfah framework).
- **Docs**: decision doc updated — Phase 2b-ummah marked complete with behavior-change rationale; Phase 2c deferred clusters enumerated (sources 4, dynamic 2, route-id-mismatch 1 — 7 remaining).

## [2026-04-16] refactor | CeremonyGuard Phase 2a — lift gating for 5 business-module pages

- **App.jsx**: 5 standalone routes (`/app/work`, `/app/money`, `/app/people`, `/app/office`, `/app/tech`) wrapped in `<CeremonyGuard moduleId="...">`. Embedded child routes under `/work/:projectId/*` left unwrapped (option a) — parent `Project` route's own "work" in-body gate already covers them; matches pre-refactor behavior where the per-module in-body gate skipped when `embedded === true`.
- **5 page files stripped**: `Work.jsx`, `Money.jsx`, `People.jsx`, `Office.jsx`, `Tech.jsx` — removed `useThresholdStore` + `CeremonyGate` imports, `hasCompletedOpening` subscription, and in-body gate return. `embedded` prop preserved — still governs `<PillarHeader>` rendering. No other hooks/state touched.
- **Embedded-variant decision recorded**: option (a) — standalone-only gating. Zero behavioral change. Two alternatives considered and rejected: (b) gating both locations would require re-confirming a module-specific opening inside every project tab — unwanted friction; (c) retaining the in-body `!embedded` check would leave dead gate code and block import cleanup.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (2529 modules, 1.37s). Preview: cleared `bbiz_thr_open`, confirmed all 5 standalone routes show CeremonyGate ("This module begins with an opening threshold"). Set all 5 `completedOpening` flags → confirmed all 5 render their own content (Work project list, Money dashboard, People tabs, Office chat, Tech overview). Visited `/app/work/ummah_moontrance-land_core/money` → Money renders as embedded tab with no per-module gate (Project's "work" gate satisfies it). Screenshot saved.
- **Docs**: decision doc updated — Phase 2a marked complete with embedded-variant decision; Phase 2b deferred clusters enumerated (ummah 4, sources 4, dynamic 2, route-id-mismatch 1).
- **Remaining thick pages (~11)**: ummah cluster (`FamilyPage`, `Neighbors`, `Community`, `CollectivePage`), sources cluster (`FivePillars`, `HadithPage`, `IslamicKnowledgePage`, `QuranPage`), dynamic (`ModulePlaceholder`, `ComingSoon`), route-id-mismatch (`Project`). Each needs its own audit — deferred.

## [2026-04-16] refactor | CeremonyGuard Phase 1 — route-level gating for 28 thin pages

- **New component** `src/components/islamic/CeremonyGuard.jsx` — thin wrapper that reads `useThresholdStore((s) => !!s.completedOpening[moduleId])` and renders either `<CeremonyGate moduleId />` or `children`. Intentionally prop-driven only (no `useParams`) — dynamic-moduleId cases deferred to Phase 2.
- **App.jsx** imports `CeremonyGuard` and wraps 28 thin routes: faith-shahada/salah/zakah/sawm/hajj, life-physical/mental/safety/social, intellect-learning/thinking/cognitive/professional, family-marriage/parenting/kinship/home, wealth-earning/financial/ownership/circulation, env-resource/waste/ecosystem/sourcing, moontrance-land/seasonal/residency.
- **28 page files simplified** via one-shot refactor script — removed `useThresholdStore` + `CeremonyGate` imports and the 2-line gate check; page bodies reduced to pure content (e.g. `FaithSalahPage` from 9 lines to 5). No behavior change — guard runs the same store subscription and gate UI.
- **Thick pages untouched (~16)** — Work, Money, People, Office, Tech, Project, FamilyPage, Neighbors, Community, CollectivePage, FivePillars, HadithPage, IslamicKnowledgePage, QuranPage, ModulePlaceholder, ComingSoon. These have hooks before gate check, dynamic moduleId, embedded variants, or route-id mismatches (Project gates "work"). Phase 2 will audit case-by-case.
- **Docs**: `src/components/islamic/CONTEXT.md` rewritten to document the two coexisting modes (route-level vs. in-body). Decision doc `wiki/decisions/2026-04-16-ceremony-guard-route-level.md` created. Memory `project_ceremony_guard_refactor.md` updated — Phase 1 done, Phase 2 deferred.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (2529 modules, 1.07s). Preview spot-checks: `/app/faith-salah` shows CeremonyGate when `bbiz_thr_open` empty; shows pillar content after marking complete; `/app/wealth-earning`, `/app/env-resource`, `/app/moontrance-land` all gate via new guard; `/app/money` (thick, unchanged) still gates via in-body logic.

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 2 — universal-layer pillar fallback + 6 pillar entries (Phase 2 closed)

- **Code change**: `getModuleData(id, 'universal')` now mirrors the Phase 0 pause-question pattern — exact `UNIVERSAL_EQUIV[id]` → `UNIVERSAL_EQUIV[getPillarForModule(id).id]` → `null`. Previously returned `null` for any sub-module not explicitly keyed (i.e., all of them).
- **6 new pillar entries in `UNIVERSAL_EQUIV`** — full `work`-shape secular-ethics content, zero Islamic terminology:
  - `faith` — Integrity / Meaning — values-coherence + purpose-direction framing
  - `life` — Sustainability / Rest — capacity-pace + recovery-release framing
  - `intellect` — Rigor / Humility — evidence-reasoning + openness-correction framing
  - `wealth` — Stewardship / Sufficiency — deliberate-use + enough-contentment framing (distinct from legacy `money` entry which remains untouched)
  - `environment` — Trusteeship / Foresight — care-for-place + long-horizon framing
  - `ummah` — Presence / Contribution — attention-to-others + what-I-add framing
- Each entry: `principles[2]`, `mindfulness` + `resumeMindfulness` + `closingMindfulness`, `readiness` (frame + 2 labels + 6 rows with `{id, attr, attrTitle?, attrFrame?, yesLabel?, notYetLabel?, governing, notYet}` + `governing[6]` + `notYet[6]`), `reflection` (frame + 2 labels + `governing[2]` + `notYet[2]`).
- **Family anomaly (option a)** — pre-existing `UNIVERSAL_EQUIV.family` carried Islamic-style content (Al-Wadud/Al-Qayyum attrs + Arabic dua from Al-Furqan 25:74 + closingDua from Al-Ahqaf 46:15 + flat 3-string readiness) in the universal layer — inconsistent with the layer's opt-out-of-Islamic-framing purpose. Reshaped to secular `work`-shape pattern with user approval this session: principles Presence/Mercy, full mindfulness strings, 6-row readiness, full reflection. Islamic Family content preserved in `MODULE_ATTRS.family` (commit `fd8a0e8`, Phase 1 Family).
- Verification: `npm run build` passes (2528 modules, 1.08s); preview eval of `getModuleData(id, 'universal')` for 12 sample ids confirmed — 6 pillar sub-module samples (`faith-salah`, `life-physical`, `intellect-learning`, `wealth-earning`, `env-resource`, `moontrance-land`) each fall back to correct pillar entry with 6 rows, mindfulness strings present, zero Arabic/Islamic terms; 5 legacy entries (`work`, `money`, `people`, `office`, `tech`) resolve directly without fallback; `family-marriage` correctly falls back to reshaped secular `family` pillar.
- **Phase 2 closed.** Decision doc `wiki/decisions/2026-04-16-threshold-content-phased-fix.md` updated — Phase 2 marked complete, family-anomaly option (a) recorded.

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Ummah — Islamic content for 5 Ummah sub-modules (Phase 1 closed)

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for `neighbors` (Al-Wadūd/Al-Muḥsin), `community` (Al-Jāmiʿ/Al-Walī — Al-Walī axis to avoid pillar duplication), `moontrance-land` (Al-Khāliq/Al-Bāriʾ), `moontrance-seasonal` (Al-Mudabbir/Al-Fattāḥ), `moontrance-residency` (Al-Walī/Al-Ḥafīẓ). Asma ul-Husna pairings match `src/data/modules.js:100-128, 496-542`.
- Each block carries unique `dua` + `closingDua` + 5 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows. Sources: An-Nisāʾ 4:36 / Bukhari 6014–Muslim 2624 (neighbors), Āl ʿImrān 3:103 / Al-Ḥujurāt 49:10 (community), Al-Baqarah 2:30 / Al-Aʿrāf 7:56 (moontrance-land), Al-Anʿām 6:99 / Bukhari 2320 sadaqah-jāriyah hadith (moontrance-seasonal), Al-Ḥashr 59:9 Ansar verse / Ash-Shūrā 42:38 (moontrance-residency). No source duplication with pillar (Al-Hashr 59:10) or pre-existing `collective` block (An-Naml 27:19 / Al-Mulk 67:15).
- **Scope correction during session**: initial brief listed 6 sub-modules, but `collective` was already authored pre-Phase 1 (legacy block at line 535, Al-Khāliq/Ar-Razzāq — Moontrance umbrella). Scope reduced to 5 new blocks; existing `collective` block left untouched.
- **PAUSE_QUESTIONS.ummah** + **PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.ummah** added — all six `ummah.subModuleIds` inherit via Phase 0's pillar fallback.
- Pillar-level `ummah` block (Al-Raḥīm/Al-Jāmiʿ, Al-Hashr 59:10 — recovered from Phase 0 people→ummah rename) left untouched.
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; preview eval of `getModuleData` confirmed all 5 blocks load with distinct attrs/dua/closing sources, 5 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows each; `getPauseQuestion('moontrance-land')` and `getPauseQuestionUniversal('neighbors')` return the new ummah pillar-level fallback correctly.
- **Phase 1 closed.** All seven pillars now carry per-sub-module Islamic-layer content or legitimate pillar fallback. Decision doc `wiki/decisions/2026-04-16-threshold-content-phased-fix.md` updated to mark Ummah ✓ and declare Phase 1 complete.
- Progress: Family ✓ · Faith ✓ · Life ✓ · Intellect ✓ · Wealth ✓ · Environment ✓ · **Ummah ✓ — Phase 1 complete.** Phase 2 (universal layer mirror) now open.

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Environment — Islamic content for 4 Environment sub-modules

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for `env-resource` (Al-Muḥyī/Al-Badīʿ), `env-waste` (Al-Quddūs/Aṭ-Ṭāhir), `env-ecosystem` (Al-Ḥafīẓ/Ar-Raqīb), `env-sourcing` (Al-ʿAlīm/Ar-Rashīd). Asma ul-Husna pairings match `src/data/modules.js:433-475`.
- Each block carries unique `dua` + `closingDua` + 5 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows. Sources: Al-Anbiya 21:30 / Al-Araf 7:31 (resource), Al-Baqarah 2:222 / Ar-Rum 30:41 (waste), Al-Anam 6:165 / Musnad Ahmad 12902 sapling hadith (ecosystem), Al-Baqarah 2:172 / Al-Baqarah 2:188 (sourcing).
- **PAUSE_QUESTIONS.environment** + **PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.environment** added — all four `env-*` sub-modules inherit via Phase 0's pillar fallback.
- Pillar-level `environment` block (Al-Wakīl) left untouched.
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; `getModuleData` confirmed via preview eval — all 4 blocks load with distinct attrs/dua/closing sources; `getPauseQuestion('env-resource')` and `getPauseQuestionUniversal('env-waste')` both return the new pillar-level fallback correctly.
- Commit: `1372038`
- Progress: Phase 1 pillar order → Family ✓ · Faith ✓ · Life ✓ · Intellect ✓ · Wealth ✓ · **Environment ✓** · Ummah (Ummah carries valid content from Phase 0 people→ummah rename; Phase 1 Islamic layer now complete pending Ummah review).

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Wealth — Islamic content for 4 Wealth sub-modules

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for `wealth-earning` (Ar-Razzāq/Al-Fattāḥ), `wealth-financial` (Ar-Razzāq/Al-Ghanī), `wealth-ownership` (Al-ʿAdl/Al-Muqsiṭ), `wealth-circulation` (Al-Karīm/Al-Wahhāb). Asma ul-Husna pairings match `src/data/modules.js:387-429`.
- Each block carries unique `dua` + `closingDua` + 5 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows. Sources: Tirmidhi 3563 / Hud 11:6 (earning), Musnad Ahmad variant / Fatir 35:15 (financial), An-Nahl 16:90 / An-Nisa 4:135 (ownership), Ali Imran 3:92 / Al-Baqarah 2:261 (circulation).
- **PAUSE_QUESTIONS.wealth** + **PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.wealth** added — all four `wealth-*` sub-modules inherit via Phase 0's pillar fallback.
- Pillar-level `wealth` block (Al-Razzāq/Al-Ḥasīb) left untouched.
- Scope note: the wealth pillar's `subModuleIds` also includes 5 legacy feature modules (`work`, `money`, `people`, `office`, `tech`) which already carry their own `MODULE_ATTRS` blocks from the top of the file. Session scope was explicitly limited to the four Maqasid `wealth-*` sub-modules per plan.
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; `getModuleData` confirmed via preview eval — all 4 blocks load with distinct attrs/dua/closing sources; `getPauseQuestion('wealth-earning')` and `getPauseQuestionUniversal('wealth-financial')` both return the new pillar-level fallback correctly.
- Commit: `887f944`
- Progress: Phase 1 pillar order → Family ✓ · Faith ✓ · Life ✓ · Intellect ✓ · **Wealth ✓** · Environment · Ummah (Ummah carries valid content from Phase 0).

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Intellect — Islamic content for 4 Intellect sub-modules

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for `intellect-learning` (Al-ʿAlīm/Al-Khabīr), `intellect-thinking` (Al-Ḥakīm/Al-Baṣīr), `intellect-cognitive` (Al-Muhaymin/Al-Ḥafīẓ — shared with `life-safety` but distinct framing toward attention-stewardship), `intellect-professional` (Al-Muṣawwir/Al-Bāriʾ). Asma ul-Husna pairings match `src/data/modules.js:286-328`.
- Each block carries unique `dua` + `closingDua` + 5 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows. Sources: Ta-Ha 20:114 / Ibn Majah 251 (learning), Ash-Shuʿara 26:83 / traditional ḥaqq-bāṭil duʿāʾ (thinking), Ta-Ha 20:25–26 / Sahih Muslim 2722 (cognitive), traditional yassir duʿāʾ / Muʿjam al-Awsaṭ 897 itqān hadith (professional).
- **PAUSE_QUESTIONS.intellect** + **PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.intellect** added — all four `intellect-*` sub-modules inherit via Phase 0's pillar fallback.
- Pillar-level `intellect` block (Al-Fattāḥ/Al-ʿAlīm) left untouched.
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; `getModuleData` confirmed via preview eval — all 4 blocks load with distinct attrs/dua/closing sources; `getPauseQuestion('intellect-learning')` and `getPauseQuestionUniversal('intellect-thinking')` both return the new pillar-level fallback correctly.
- Commit: `6979374`
- Progress: Phase 1 pillar order → Family ✓ · Faith ✓ · Life ✓ · **Intellect ✓** · Wealth · Environment · Ummah (Ummah carries valid content from Phase 0).

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Life — Islamic content for 4 Life sub-modules

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for `life-physical` (Al-Muhyi/Ash-Shafi), `life-mental` (As-Salam/Al-Latif), `life-safety` (Al-Muhaymin/Al-Hafiz), `life-social` (Al-Wadud/Al-Muhsin). Asma ul-Husna pairings match `src/data/modules.js:240-282`.
- Each block carries unique `dua` + `closingDua` + 5 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows. Sources: Abu Dawud 5090 / Quran 26:80 (physical), Quran 13:28 / Ta-Ha 20:25–27 (mental), Quran 12:64 / Abu Dawud 5088 (safety), Quran 28:77 / Fussilat 41:34 (social).
- **PAUSE_QUESTIONS.life** + **PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.life** added — all four `life-*` sub-modules inherit via Phase 0's pillar fallback.
- Pillar-level `life` block (Al-Qawī/Al-Laṭīf) left untouched.
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; `getModuleData` confirmed via preview eval — all 4 blocks load with distinct attrs/dua/closing sources; `getPauseQuestion('life-physical')` and `getPauseQuestionUniversal('life-mental')` both return the new pillar-level fallback correctly. Screenshot tool was unresponsive during this session — visual ceremony verification skipped, data-layer checks substituted.
- Commit: `443e02c`
- Progress: Phase 1 pillar order → Family ✓ · Faith ✓ · **Life ✓** · Intellect · Wealth · Environment · Ummah (Ummah carries valid content from Phase 0 people→ummah rename).

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Faith — Islamic content for 9 Faith sub-modules

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for the five pillars of Islam, the Sources module, and the three board tiers (`faith-shahada` Al-Ahad/As-Samad, `faith-salah` Al-Qarib/Al-Mujib, `faith-zakah` Ar-Razzaq/Al-Karim, `faith-sawm` As-Sabur/Ash-Shakur, `faith-hajj` Al-Malik/Al-Quddus, `sources` Al-Hadi/Al-Alim, `faith-core` Al-Muhyi/Al-Qayyum for Daruriyyat, `faith-growth` Ar-Rafi/Al-Fattah for Hajiyyat, `faith-excellence` Al-Muhsin/Al-Jamil for Tahsiniyyat)
- Each block carries unique `dua` + `closingDua` + 3–4 readiness rows + 2 reflection rows; Asma ul-Husna pairings match `src/data/modules.js` attrs strings
- **`faith-core`/`faith-growth`/`faith-excellence`** carry tier-specific (Daruriyyat/Hajiyyat/Tahsiniyyat) framing rather than pillar fallback — resolves the open call from `wiki/decisions/2026-04-16-threshold-content-phased-fix.md`
- **PAUSE_QUESTIONS.faith** + **PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.faith** added — all six `faith-*` sub-modules inside `faith.subModuleIds` inherit via Phase 0's pillar fallback
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; `getModuleData` confirms all 9 blocks load with distinct attrs/dua/closing sources; `getPauseQuestion('faith-salah')` correctly falls back to the pillar question
- Pillar-level `faith` block (Al-Mutakabbir/Al-Wakil) already existed and was left untouched
- Commit: `e72ebc5`

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 1 Family — Islamic content for pillar + 5 sub-modules

- **MODULE_ATTRS blocks** added for `family` (Al-Wadud/Ar-Rahman), `family-marriage` (Al-Wadud/As-Salam), `family-parenting` (Ar-Rabb/Al-Hafiz), `family-kinship` (Al-Wakil/Ash-Shakur), `family-home` (As-Salam/Al-Quddus), `family-office` (Al-Jami/Al-Hafiz)
- Each block: unique dua (Ar-Rum 30:21, Ibrahim 14:40, An-Nisa 4:1, Al-Muminun 23:29, Ali Imran 3:8), closingDua, 4–5 readiness rows, 2 reflection rows with governing/notYet pairs
- **PAUSE_QUESTIONS.family** + **PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.family** added — all five sub-modules inherit the pillar-level pause question via Phase 0's fallback
- Verification: build passes; `family-marriage` ceremony renders Ar-Rum 30:21 dua and Al-Wadud/As-Salam attrs panel correctly in preview DOM
- Commit: `fd8a0e8`

## [2026-04-16] feat | Phase 0 — Threshold popup code-path fixes

- **Pause-question pillar fallback**: added `getPauseQuestion` / `getPauseQuestionUniversal` helpers in `src/data/islamic/islamic-data.js` that try module id → pillar id → `work` default. Wired into `DEFER_CONTENT.getGuidanceQuestion`, `DEFER_UNIVERSAL.getGuidanceQuestion`, and `ThresholdModal.jsx:222-224`. Replaces silent `PAUSE_QUESTIONS[id] || PAUSE_QUESTIONS.work` default that hit 36 of 42 modules.
- **`people` triple-key collision fixed**: renamed the line 1105 `MODULE_ATTRS.people` block (Al-Raḥīm · Al-Jāmiʿ, Surah Al-Hashr 59:10) to `ummah`, reviving the shadowed line 230 `people` module-level block (Al-Wadud · Al-Adl) and filling the Ummah pillar gap for free.
- **Orphan `crm` content deleted**: removed `MODULE_ATTRS.crm`, `UNIVERSAL_EQUIV.crm`, and `PAUSE_QUESTIONS.crm` / `PAUSE_UNIVERSAL.questions.crm` entries. CRM lives under People → Sales Pipeline tab; standalone module was unrouted.
- **Unrouted dead code deleted**: `src/pages/modules/CRM.jsx` + `CRM.css`.
- Verification: `npm run build` passes; lint clean on touched files; browser smoke test confirmed People module shows module-level Dua and Ummah pillar renders renamed content.
- Decision recorded: `wiki/decisions/2026-04-16-threshold-content-phased-fix.md`. Phase 1 (Islamic content pillar-by-pillar, starting with Family) and Phase 2 (universal layer) still to come.

## [2026-04-16] feat | Expand wealth + environment subtask descriptions with Why/How format

- **Wealth seed file** (`src/data/seed-tasks/wealth-seed-tasks.js`): added `description` template literals to all **236 subtasks** across 4 submodules (Earning & Provision, Financial Literacy & Management, Ownership & Rights, Circulation & Impact) × 3 boards (core, growth, excellence)
- **Environment seed file** (`src/data/seed-tasks/environment-seed-tasks.js`): added `description` template literals to all **226 subtasks** across 4 submodules (Resource Consumption, Waste & Pollution, Ecosystem & Biodiversity, Ethical Sourcing & Circularity) × 3 boards
- **Total: 462 subtask descriptions** added, completing 6 of 7 Maqasid pillars (Faith, Life, Intellect, Family, Wealth, Environment). Ummah remains.
- All descriptions follow the **Why does this matter? / How do I accomplish this?** format with Islamic grounding (Quranic references, hadith, fiqhi principles) and practical actionable steps
- Files grew from ~600 lines each to ~12,000+ lines. Build passes cleanly.

## [2026-04-16] feat | Source(s) button + subtask content system for TaskDetailPanel

- **Source(s) button** added to all subtask footers (always visible, globally standard across all modules)
- **Sources slide-in view** — clicking opens a 4th panel view rendering `activeSubtask.sources` as markdown with blue underlined links opening in new tabs; empty state shown when no sources yet
- **`sources` field** added to subtask data model — propagated by `seedTasks` and backfilled by `backfillSeedDescriptions` in `project-store.js`
- **Backfill upgraded** — now syncs description whenever seed differs from stored (not just when longer), enabling intentional content updates
- **Rich descriptions populated** for 5 faith/shahada subtasks using the `subtask-content` skill: Recite the full Shahada, Study the linguistic meaning, Learn what negation/affirmation entail, Understand worship without partners, Review Quranic ayat on Tawhid
- **Sources data** added to 3 of those subtasks (Understand worship, Review Quranic ayat, Study linguistic meaning)
- **Subtask hint text** updated: "(tap each one for more info)" → "(tap each one to see why and how)"
- **Task title** made globally read-only in TaskDetailPanel (readOnly attribute + CSS pointer-events: none)
- **Ayah banner** corrected: "no god but God" → "no god but Allah" in Quran 47:19 translation

## [2026-04-15] fix | Rename "Task Document" button to "Resources" in TaskDetailPanel footer

## [2026-04-15] feat | Dashboard pipeline stage cards deep-link to correct stage
- Each `.bfd__pipeline-stage` card on the Dashboard now navigates to its specific BBOS stage.
- Implementation: React Router `location.state.stage` (not URL search params — `useSearchParams()` returned empty in the router context; location state is immune to Strict Mode remounting).
- `Dashboard.jsx`: added `state={{ stage: stageId }}` to each stage Link.
- `ProjectBoard.jsx`: added `useLocation`, initializes `bbosFilter` from `location.state?.stage`.

## [2026-04-15] fix | TodayFocusSection light-mode contrast fixes
- **Card name contrast**: `.tfs-card__name` was hardcoded `#e4e8f4` (near-white), invisible on the light-tinted card background. Changed to `var(--text)`.
- **Arabic subtitle opacity**: Inline style changed from `accentColor + '80'` (50% opacity) to full `accentColor` — legible on light surface.
- **CTA card dark-mode bleed**: All hardcoded dark hex values in `.tfs-cta` block replaced with CSS variables (`--bg3/4`, `--border/2`, `--text2/3`).
- **CTA interactivity**: Converted outer `<div class="tfs-cta">` to `<button>` (full-card click target). Removed inner "Set focus →" button element entirely.

## [2026-04-15] fix | Permanent mobile nav bottom-blocking fix + task modal features
- **Mobile nav architecture fix**: Removed `position: fixed` from MobileNav, placed in CSS grid flow (`grid-row: 3`). Eliminates recurring bug where bottom content was obscured (~20 prior fix attempts). Added `--mobile-nav-h` token. Cleaned up padding-bottom hacks in DashboardView, PillarBoard, Sidebar.
- **Task Document slide-in**: Wired "Task Document" footer button in TaskDetailPanel to open secondary panel with status, priority, assignee, due date, tags fields. Keyed remount animation for slide transitions.
- **BBOS form validation**: Done button in BbosTaskPanel now validates all required fields, shows red banner + inline error highlighting + shake animation when empty.
- **Save for Later button**: Added to BbosTaskPanel footer — saves current field data and closes without validation.
- **Gate indicator links**: Made BBOS gate diamonds (◆) in LevelNavigator clickable — navigates to stage and scrolls to Stage Health Score section.
- **Removed segment percentage labels**: Removed `fln__segment-pct` from LevelNavigator per user request.
- **Mobile responsive pass**: Both TaskDetailPanel and BbosTaskPanel go full-screen on mobile with adjusted spacing.
- **AppShell TDZ fix**: Moved `useLocation()` declaration before its usage in useEffect to fix temporal dead zone crash.

## [2026-04-15] audit+fix | WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Audit (System Report §11.9)

## [2026-04-15] implement | People Module Stabilization (System Report §11.6)
- Audit confirmed module is stable — not mid-refactor as report suggested. 42 .jsx files, 3 stores, 6 sub-directories all functional.
- **CompanyNotesTab:** Wired to contacts-store — notes now persist via `updateCompany(companyId, { notes })`. Was local-only state.
- **WorkTab:** Replaced hardcoded onboarding stubs with real task data from task-store. Added `getTasksByAssignee(assigneeId)` to task-store. Shows tasks across all projects with priority, due date, status.
- **SkillsTab:** Built tag-based skill management UI. Skills stored as `skills` array on contact record via `updateContact`. Add/remove with Enter/click.
- **DetailPanelTabs:** Fixed SkillsTab call to pass `contactId` prop (was called with no props).
- Updated CONTEXT.md files: `people/CONTEXT.md` (master) and `tabs/CONTEXT.md` — removed stale stub references, documented new store dependencies.
- Files modified: CompanyNotesTab.jsx, WorkTab.jsx, SkillsTab.jsx, DetailPanelTabs.jsx, task-store.js, people/CONTEXT.md, tabs/CONTEXT.md

## [2026-04-15] implement | BBOS UI/Protocol Gap Closure (System Report §11.4)
- Closed 3 of 4 gaps from system report section 11.4 (gap #1 Two-Factory was already resolved)
- **Assembly Gate CLEARED state:** Added green CLEARED bar rendering when all Research tasks are Done (was only showing LOCKED)
- **G-Label badge on dashboard cards:** GLabelBadge now renders on BbosFullDashboard task cards when G1-G4 label is assigned; static "G" chip remains as placeholder when unassigned
- **00A/01B patch stage indicators:** Added `BBOS_PATCH_STAGES` data to `bbos-pipeline.js`; `gateIndicators` prop added to LevelNavigator; inline diamond indicators render between FND-TRU and STR-OFR in Think layer with 3-state coloring (pending/in-progress/complete)
- Fixed stale `CONTEXT.md` reference to non-existent `BbosPipelineHeader.jsx`
- Files modified: BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.css, bbos-pipeline.js, ProjectBoard.jsx, LevelNavigator.jsx, LevelNavigator.css, bbos/CONTEXT.md

## [2026-04-15] reskin | Task Modal + BBOS Panel + Factory Tabs
- **Task Detail Modal:** Full CSS rewrite of TaskDetailPanel (672px, 24px radius, `--tdp-accent` theming, circular subtask checkboxes, progress bar, spacious layout). JSX restructured: priority badge, read-only description, single "Task Document" footer button. Removed secondary controls from render.
- **BBOS Task Panel:** CSS rewrite of BbosTaskPanel to match new design language. JSX restructured: badges row (stage + status inline select), meta row (assignee + governing attributes), purpose section, bento grid (dependencies + template cards), rationale accordion, form fields, G-Label, notes container, validation flags, AI draft section, discard-with-confirmation footer.
- **Accent color wiring:** `accentColor` prop threaded from PillarLevelPage/ProjectBoard → TaskDetailPanel → BbosTaskPanel. Level colors: core=#C8A96E, growth=#4ab8a8, excellence=#8b5cf6.
- **Factory tab animation:** Directional slide on Groundwork↔Workshop switch using keyed remount + `useRef` direction tracking. Grid layout fix for wrapper div (mirrors parent 12-col grid). Fixed undefined `--radius-md` token → `--radius`.

- Files modified: TaskDetailPanel.jsx/css, BbosTaskPanel.jsx/css, BbosFullDashboard.jsx/css, PillarLevelPage.jsx, ProjectBoard.jsx
- Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-task-modal-reskin-design.md`

## [2026-04-15] implement | Chart Tooltips — Shared ChartTooltip component + 8 chart wiring
- **Design:** Brainstormed with visual companion mockups, produced spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-chart-tooltips-design.md`
- **Shared component:** Created `src/components/shared/ChartTooltip.jsx` + `.css` — portal-rendered tooltip via `createPortal(el, document.body)`, same pattern as IslamicTerm glossary tooltips
- **Two anchor modes:** `above` (bar/ring/gauge — centered above target, flips below if < 180px headroom) and `crosshair` (line charts — vertical dashed line + floating tooltip, enlarges hovered circle)
- **8 charts wired:**
  1. Money bar chart (MoneyDashboard.jsx) — month, expenses, discretionary, over-budget
  2. BCG line chart (Dashboard.jsx) — crosshair, task count + day label
  3. Activity chart (ActivityChart.jsx) — crosshair, task count + day label
  4. Savings donut (MoneyDashboard.jsx) — % saved, saved/spent amounts
  5. Mastery ring (PillarLevelDashboard.jsx) — % complete, tasks done/total
  6. Workflow pressure (Dashboard.jsx) — level, filled/10, in-progress count
  7. Spending limit bar (MoneyDashboard.jsx) — amount/budget, % over
  8. Cost analysis rows (MoneyDashboard.jsx) — category, %, dollar amount
- **Interaction:** Desktop hover (150ms fade), mobile tap-to-toggle with outside-tap dismiss
- **Execution:** Subagent-driven development — 10 tasks, parallel dispatch for independent files
- Files created: ChartTooltip.jsx, ChartTooltip.css | Files modified: MoneyDashboard.jsx, Dashboard.jsx, ActivityChart.jsx, PillarLevelDashboard.jsx
- Wiki: created `wiki/entities/chart-tooltips.md`, updated `wiki/entities/money-dashboard.md`

## [2026-04-15] documentation | Comprehensive System Report — Maqasid OS V2.1

## [2026-04-15] audit+implement | UI/UX Audit — Border/Shadow + Typography Scale Consolidation (Dimensions 4 & 5 continued)
- Continuation of April 14 UI/UX audit; scoped to border+shadow redundancy and typography scale consolidation
- **Phase 1 — New tokens defined in tokens.css:**
  - Typography: added `--text-2xs` (0.7rem), `--text-sm-plus` (0.8rem) to fill gaps in 8-step UI scale
  - Display scale: added `--text-2xl` through `--text-7xl` (1.75rem–3.75rem) for hero/page-level headings
  - Shadows: added `--shadow-card`, `--shadow-card-hover`, `--shadow-accent`, `--shadow-glow-green`, `--shadow-glow-amber`, `--shadow-glow-red`, `--shadow-glow-cyan`
  - Dark theme overrides added for all new shadow tokens
- **Phase 2 — Shadow consolidation (37 hardcoded box-shadow + 7 hardcoded border colors):**
  - Replaced dashboard card shadows (DashboardTaskCard, BbosFullDashboard, PillarLevelDashboard) → `--shadow-card` / `--shadow-card-hover`
  - Replaced audit CTA button shadows across 7 pillar dashboards + QuranPage + HadithPage → `--shadow-xs` / `--shadow-lg`
  - Replaced glow shadows in TechOverview + HealthPulse → `--shadow-glow-*` tokens
  - Replaced accent shadows in ThresholdModal + ResumeOverlay → `--shadow-accent`
  - Replaced panel shadows in TaskDetailPanel + BbosTaskPanel → `--shadow-lg`
  - Replaced hardcoded border colors in BbosFullDashboard, PillarBoard, TechOverview, WealthDashboard → semantic tokens
  - Office focus rings (Announcements, DocumentManager, Forum) → `--col-progress-bg`
- **Phase 3 — Typography scale consolidation (580+ hardcoded font-size declarations):**
  - Mapped all font-size values to nearest token: 0.5–0.65rem → `--text-xs`, 0.66–0.72rem → `--text-2xs`, 0.73–0.77rem → `--text-sm`, 0.78–0.84rem → `--text-sm-plus`, 0.85–0.93rem → `--text-base`, 0.94–1.06rem → `--text-md`, 1.07–1.19rem → `--text-lg`, 1.2–1.5rem → `--text-xl`, 1.6+ → display tokens
  - Converted pixel font-sizes (9px–18px) to rem token equivalents
  - Sub-0.65rem values raised to `--text-xs` (enforcing P1 floor from prior audit)
  - Result: 0 hardcoded font-size values remain in CSS (excluding 2 clamp() responsive declarations)
- **Before:** 5.8% token adoption (36/618 font-size declarations), 37 hardcoded shadows
- **After:** 100% token adoption for font-size, 100% for box-shadow, 100% for border colors
- Build verified clean; preview spot-checked on Money, Dashboard, Faith pillar — no regressions
- Files modified: tokens.css + ~50 CSS files across src/components/ and src/pages/

## [2026-04-15] implement | Money Dashboard chart — expense-based segments + isEssential categories
- **Balance Overview chart restructure:**
  - Bar height now based on `expenses` (was `income`); no surplus/income spacer
  - 3 segments (bottom → top): Expenses (dark green) · Discretionary Spending (light green = budget headroom) · Over Budget (purple hatched)
  - Discretionary Spending = `max(0, budgetTarget − expenses)` — bars reach exactly to Max Target line when under budget
  - All 4 corners rounded per segment (`border-radius: 4px`); stack background removed
  - Ceiling = `niceMax(max(expenses, budgetTarget))` across all months
- **`isEssential` flag on preset categories:**
  - Added to `PRESET_CATEGORIES` in `money-categories.js`
  - Essential: Rent, Utility, Utility Bills, Transport, Payroll; all others `false`
  - `chartData` carries `essential`/`discretionary` per month (chart renders all expenses as one block for now)
- Files: MoneyDashboard.jsx, MoneyDashboard.css, money-categories.js, wiki/entities/money-dashboard.md

## [2026-04-15] implement | Hadith sourcing audit + segment nav wrapping + money chart redesign
- **Hadith audit:** scanned entire codebase for non-Sahih hadith references; found 3 issues
  - NiyyahAct.jsx: Tirmidhi 3391 → Sahih Muslim 2723 (morning/evening duas), added time-of-day logic via `getDua()` selector
  - islamic-data.js LIFE module closing dua: Tirmidhi 3401 → Quran 26:78–80 (Ibrahim AS on creation, sustenance, healing)
  - quran-overview.js HIFZ virtues: Abu Dawud claims → Sahih Muslim 804 & 798 (Quran intercession, reciters' reward)
  - All 40+ Quranic ayat already sourced to Quran; all other module duas already Quran/Sahih
- **LevelNavigator segment nav wrapping:** segment buttons ("EARNING & PROVISION", etc.) overlapping on small screens
  - Root cause: `.fln__segment-nav` had `white-space: nowrap` with no width constraint
  - Fix: `white-space: normal` + `max-width: 100%` allows wrapping into 2 lines on narrow viewports
  - Tested: 600px → labels wrap cleanly; 1280px → single line preserved
- **Money Dashboard chart redesign:** relabel and recolor for clarity
  - Legend changed: "Income" → "Expenses", "Expenses" → "Discretionary Spending"
  - Color change: expense bar from yellow (#fde68a) → light mint (#86efac) for visual distinction from income green (#22c55e)
  - Bar order reordered: over-budget now appears above expenses (visually correct priority)
  - Data binding fixed: bar height still driven by `d.income`; dark green background shows savings gap; light green = `withinExpenses` (budgeted portion); purple = `overBudget` spike
- Files: NiyyahAct.jsx, islamic-data.js, quran-overview.js, LevelNavigator.css, MoneyDashboard.jsx, MoneyDashboard.css
- Commit: 6f0c72d

## [2026-04-14] implement | Money Dashboard — Balance overview chart redesign
- Replaced weekly side-by-side bar chart with monthly stacked bar chart (9 months)
- Chart logic: bar height = monthly income; expenses (yellow) from bottom; transparent spacer holds savings gap; income background shows through
- Added Y-axis labels, horizontal gridlines, dashed budget target line ("Max Target Spending"), over-budget purple hatched segment
- Legend repositioned below chart; Income · Expenses · Over budget
- Fixed double-counting bug (previously stacked savings + income + expenses additively)
- Fixed flex sizing bug (transparent spacer required so expense segment doesn't stretch to fill full bar)
- New wiki entity: `wiki/entities/money-dashboard.md`

## [2026-04-14] implement | Font family tokenization — codebase-wide
- Extended font token system introduced in the P0 session to all remaining files (50+ files)
- New tokens added: `--font-display` (Manrope + DM Sans fallback), `--font-serif` (Noto Serif)
- Full token set: `--font-body`, `--font-heading`, `--font-display`, `--font-serif`, `--font-arabic`, `--font-mono`

## [2026-04-14] audit+implement | UI/UX Audit — Dashboard Design & Typography (Dimensions 4 & 5)
- Audited Dashboard against NotebookLM notebook "Modern UI/UX Design: From Bland to Bespoke Masterpiece" (ID 279ecab6, 10 YouTube sources)
- Scope: Dimension 4 (Dashboard-Specific Design) and Dimension 5 (Typography & Content)
- Scorecard: 2 Pass, 3 Fail, 5 Partial Pass, 1 Warn across 11 criteria
- **P0 remediations implemented:**
  - Empty States Overhaul — 4 section empty states upgraded from plain text to icon + human text + CTA pattern (BCG, Open Tasks, Upcoming, Activity)
  - Font Family Consolidation — added `--font-body`, `--font-heading`, `--font-arabic`, `--font-mono` tokens to tokens.css; replaced hardcoded Space Grotesk and Amiri refs in Dashboard.css with token vars; replaced inline DM Sans in BCG SVG
  - BCG Chart Fixes — renamed to "Barakah Consistency", wired range selector (7d/14d/30d) to actually filter data via `.slice(-rangeDays)`, simplified misleading dual-signal legend to "Tasks completed per day", expanded data from 14→30 days
- **P1 remediations implemented:**
  - Font Size Floor — raised all sub-10px sizes (0.58rem, 0.6rem, 0.62rem) to 0.65rem minimum (7 replacements)
  - Task List Enhancement — removed `projects.slice(0, 4)` cap, added horizontal scroll for project tabs, added due date + overdue highlighting, added "View all N tasks" link with hidden count
  - Empty State Text Rewrite — rewrote in human guiding tone ("All clear — create a task to get started", etc.)
- Verified in browser: light mode, dark mode, empty states, BCG range switching all confirmed working
- P2 items deferred: dashboard hierarchy reorder, letter-spacing standardization, task sort/search
- Files: Dashboard.jsx, Dashboard.css, tokens.css, useDashboard.js
- Audit plan: `.claude/plans/elegant-baking-umbrella.md`

## [2026-04-14] implement | Task clicks → popup modal on pillar level pages
- Removed `inlinePanel` from ProjectBoard in PillarLevelPage — DashboardTaskCard clicks now open TaskDetailPanel portal modal instead of InlineTaskDetail inline
- Added `onSubsegClick` to LevelNavigator in PillarLevelPage — subseg (task progress bar segment) clicks now open TaskDetailPanel modal instead of navigating to `?task=` URL
- State: `subsegTask { taskId, project }` held in PillarLevelPage; project resolved via `getProject(${boardPrefix}_${pillarId}_${activeLevel})`
- Verified in preview: card click opens modal, subseg click opens modal for correct task ("Testify there is no God but Allah")
- Files: PillarLevelPage.jsx

## [2026-04-14] website | Maqasid OS microsite and landing page update
- Created `website/maqasid/index.html` — product landing page with hero (59:18), purpose, threshold, solution, seven-pillar grid, CTA
- Created `website/maqasid/journey/index.html` — journey detail page with spine, now-marker at 18%, 4 phases, 8 milestones (6 done)
- Updated `website/index.html` — four-product grid, hero text, triptych, Maqasid OS product card with diamond badge
- Added Maqasid OS nav link across all 10 existing product pages (BBOS, Atlas, Moontrance and their subpages)
- Added "Full journey →" link to Maqasid OS row on ecosystem journey page
- Pushed to both onaxyzogden/Maqasid and onaxyzogden/ogden-hub
- Files: website/maqasid/{index,journey/index}.html, website/index.html, 10 nav updates, website/journey/index.html

## [2026-04-14] website | Add Maqasid OS to ecosystem journey page
- Fourth product row on `/journey/` — Development (Al-Musawwir) → Completion (Al-Muhsi) → Opening (Al-Fattah) → Ummah (Al-Wasi')
- Phase 1 at 70%: 6/8 milestones done (seven pillar modules, dashboard, BBOS integration, Islamic UI, audit, pillar viz)
- CSS: `--mq-*` color vars, `.mq` phase/milestone selectors following existing pattern
- Header updated: "Four products. Four journeys. One intention."
- Footer: fourth column with Maqasid OS summary
- Also synced milestone counts on BBOS (+Operator Practice Companion), Moontrance (+stewardship model, +first founding member), fixed Atlas footer 85→86%, date March→April
- Pushed to both onaxyzogden/Maqasid and onaxyzogden/ogden-hub
- Files: website/journey/index.html

## [2026-04-14] implement | BBOS pipeline overview panel — all 9 stages with completion %
- New `PipelineOverview` internal component in `BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — renders between stage header and task grid
- Shows all 9 stages grouped by 3 layers (Think/Execute/Reckon) with colored layer labels
- Each stage card: number (01-09), label, 3px progress bar (colored per stage), completion %
- Active stage highlighted with accent border and tinted background; labels truncate with ellipsis
- `allStageProgress` useMemo computed via single taskMap pass (O(T + D)) — returns `{ FND: 0, TRU: 45, ... }`
- Clickable stage navigation: `onStageSelect(stageId)` callback threaded ProjectBoard → DashboardView → BbosFullDashboard
- `handleStageSelect` in ProjectBoard calls `setBbosFilter + setActiveBbosStage` (same as LevelNavigator segment click)
- Responsive: layers stack vertically on screens < 768px
- Files: BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.css, DashboardView.jsx, ProjectBoard.jsx

## [2026-04-14] implement | BBOS stage complete gate — callout + advance action
- When `stagePct === 100`, a green "Stage complete" callout appears in the stage header (below the progress strip)
- Callout shows: CheckCircle icon + "Stage complete — N/N tasks done" + "Advance to [Next Stage Label] →" button
- At OPT (last stage): button shows "Complete Cycle →" and triggers `startNewBbosCycle` with a confirm dialog
- Advance handler defined in `ProjectBoard.jsx`: calls `advanceBbosStage(projectId, nextId)` + syncs UI `setBbosFilter` + `setActiveBbosStage`
- Handler threaded as `onStageAdvance` prop: ProjectBoard → DashboardView → BbosFullDashboard
- `BBOS_STAGES` imported in BbosFullDashboard to compute `nextStage` from `stageMeta.order`
- `advanceBbosStage` was already in project-store (lines 447–455) but unused — now wired up
- Files: ProjectBoard.jsx, DashboardView.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.css

## [2026-04-14] implement | BBOS pipeline progress tracking wired up
- Added per-stage completion % aggregated from task status (`columnId === doneColumnId || completedAt`)
- Stage header in `BbosFullDashboard.jsx` now shows `X/Y · Z%` with a thin 4px green progress bar below the stage description; computed against all task definitions (not just seeded tasks)
- `ProjectAuditCard` bug fixed: was using `t.completedAt` only for completion count (always null per Sprint 7 fix); now also checks `columnId === doneColumnId`; `doneColumnId` prop passed from parent
- LevelNavigator stage segments now display a `%` completion label below the stage name (e.g. "IDENTITY 0%"); computed via new `pillarProgress` useMemo in `ProjectBoard.jsx`
- Files: BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.css, ProjectBoard.jsx, LevelNavigator.jsx, LevelNavigator.css

## [2026-04-14] implement | Runway date assignment — styled modal with timeline preview
- Replaced raw `confirm()` dialog with `RunwayDateModal` component rendered via `createPortal`
- Modal shows: start-date picker, runway metadata pill, scrollable timeline of all tasks with due dates, overwrite toggle, Apply/Cancel actions
- Live preview recalculates using `useMemo` as start date changes; existing-date rows highlighted with accent tint
- `computePreview()` distributes tasks evenly across runway period (fractions of total ms); `formatPreviewDate()` for display
- CSS: ~200 lines appended to BbosTaskPanel.css — `.rda-overlay`, `.rda-modal`, `.rda-timeline`, `.rda-row`, `.rda-btn` etc.
- Files: BbosTaskPanel.jsx, BbosTaskPanel.css

## [2026-04-14] synthesize | Amanah Gate Protocol — cross-product pattern named via graphify
- Ran `/graphify website/` — 28 HTML pages converted to Markdown, 161 nodes, 162 edges, 38 communities extracted
- Graph found `semantically_similar_to` edge (INFERRED 0.72) between Atlas Confidence Framework and BBOS G-Label System — two independent implementations of the same tiered evidential honesty mechanism
- Traced the pattern: all three products (Atlas, BBOS, Moontrance) implement Amanah as a decision gate, but BBOS is the only one that named it
- Identified documentation gap: `rationale_land_as_trust` (root homepage) links to Atlas and BBOS but not Moontrance — the most land-relevant product
- Filed `wiki/decisions/2026-04-14-amanah-gate-protocol.md` — cross-product pattern definition with Moontrance M1/M2/M3 tier proposal
- Updated `wiki/concepts/amanah-gate.md` — added Protocol section distinguishing ethical gate (halal check) from evidential gate (input quality)
- Updated `website/CONTEXT.md` — cross-product architecture notes, documentation gap, graph reference
- Graph outputs at `website/graphify-out/` (graph.html, GRAPH_REPORT.md, graph.json)

## [2026-04-14] implement | Subsegment colors, TRU task reorder, runway date assignment
- Fixed subsegment in-progress color: `bbosTaskColorFn` now checks `bbosFieldData` for partial field progress, not just `columnId` — tasks with any filled fields show amber even while in the To Do column
- Reordered TRU task definitions: V1/V2/V3/FP02 moved before AF1–AF5, appearing as tasks 7–10 in the Groundwork tab (was 12–15)
- `RESEARCH_PREFIXES` in BbosFullDashboard confirmed as `['S','V','FP']`; V/FP tasks remain in Groundwork, AF tasks in Workshop
- Runway date assignment: when TRU-S5 (Constraint Map) is marked Done, all BBOS tasks in the project receive evenly-spaced due dates from today through the runway period; prompts before overwriting existing dates
- Files: ProjectBoard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosTaskPanel.jsx, bbos-task-definitions.js

## [2026-04-14] implement | Scope gate all views, task panel view-only, color picker
- Extracted shared ScopeGate component from BbosFullDashboard into src/components/shared/ScopeGate.jsx
- Passed bbosRole/bbosFilter to Board (KanbanBoard), List (ListView), and Gantt (GanttView) views
- All 4 views now show "OUTSIDE YOUR SCOPE" overlay when role lacks access to a stage
- Added VIEW ONLY banner + readOnly/disabled fields in BbosTaskPanel for V-access roles
- Added clickable project color picker (8-swatch popover) in ProjectBoard header
- Files: ScopeGate.jsx (new), BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosTaskPanel.jsx/.css, ProjectBoard.jsx, KanbanBoard.jsx, ListView.jsx, GanttView.jsx, TaskDetailPanel.jsx

## [2026-04-14] implement | BBOS role scope gate and access-level badges
- Added "OUTSIDE YOUR SCOPE" overlay (ScopeGate component) when a role has no accessible tasks in a stage
- Overlay shows role name, stage name, and which roles have access (computed from BBOS_TASK_ACCESS matrix)
- Added View/Edit chip badges on task cards reflecting the active role's permission level (V=blue, E=amber)
- Fixed sidebar button width inconsistency (Notifications narrower than Settings)
- Files: BbosFullDashboard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.css, DashboardTaskCard.css, Sidebar.css

## [2026-04-14] implement | Task modal, BBOS pipeline to Dashboard, LevelNavigator restyle
- Converted TaskDetailPanel and BbosTaskPanel from slide-in side panel to centered popup modal via `createPortal` to `document.body`; Escape key closes, backdrop click closes, panel click stops propagation
- Moved BBOS pipeline overview from BbosFullDashboard to main Dashboard — shows per-stage progress for all BBOS-enabled projects with project title heading
- Removed PipelineOverview internal component + allStageProgress useMemo from BbosFullDashboard (now dashboard-owned)
- Removed bfd__stage-progress bar, bfd__eyebrow, and bfd__title from BbosFullDashboard header (redundant with pipeline on Dashboard)
- LevelNavigator fln__segment-col--current: changed from solid color fill to subtle tint + outline (color-mix 8% + border + box-shadow) matching bfd__pipeline-stage--active style
- fln__segment-nav: 0.7rem, weight 600, var(--text), left-aligned, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.06em — matching bfd pipeline label style
- Files: TaskDetailPanel.jsx/.css, BbosTaskPanel.jsx/.css, ProjectBoard.jsx, BbosFullDashboard.jsx, Dashboard.jsx/.css, LevelNavigator.css

## [2026-04-13] rewrite | Landing page — Islamic Life OS framing, Seven Maqasid pillars
- Rewrote Landing.jsx: hero, features, How It Works, FAQ, CTA, footer
- Hero: "Organize your life around what truly matters" with 7 pillar chips (Arabic roots)
- Features: Seven Maqasid tabbed showcase replacing 5-module business framing
- Replaced SaaS pricing with 3-step How It Works (Choose Path → Explore Pillars → Track Growth)
- FAQ rewritten for life OS scope (6 questions)
- Fixed missing `getBbosTaskDef` import in BbosFullDashboard (caused blank page)
- Committed and pushed pre-existing BBOS enhancements (renderers, role picker, task panel, ErrorBoundary)

## [2026-04-13] implement | M2 tier 3 — DLR/RET/OPT/remaining renderer expansion (39→77 tasks, 68% coverage)
- Added 38 new TASK_RENDERERS entries across all remaining stages
- DLR stage: DLR-S5, DLR-A1 (StepPanel), DLR-A2/A4 (Matrix2x2), DLR-A3/A6/A7 (StepPanel), DLR-A5 (DualColumn)
- RET stage: RET-S2/S5 (DualColumn), RET-S3/S4 (Matrix2x2), RET-A1 through RET-A6 (StepPanel)
- OPT stage: OPT-S3 (DualColumn), OPT-S4/S6 (StepPanel), OPT-S5/A5 (VerdictBadge), OPT-S7/A2 (MetricBar)
- OUT/SAL remaining: OUT-A2 (DualColumn), OUT-A3/S1/S2/S3/S5/A1 (StepPanel), SAL-S0/S1/S2/S4/A1/A2 (StepPanel)
- ~36 tasks remain on DefaultTaskRenderer — mostly simple textarea-only or mixed-type fields where default is appropriate
- Build passes clean; no new CSS needed (all reuse existing renderer component styles)

## [2026-04-13] implement | M2 tier 2 — SAL/OUT renderer expansion (28→39 tasks, 35% coverage)

Added 11 new TASK_RENDERERS for SAL and OUT stages using 2 new renderer components.

### New renderer components
- **DualColumnRenderer** — paired textareas side-by-side with optional footer. For content that naturally pairs (objections+responses, scripts+alternatives, nurture+proof)
- **StepPanelRenderer** — vertical numbered cards for sequential/phased content. Numbered circle markers with step labels and truncated content

### New TASK_RENDERERS entries
- **DualColumnRenderer** (5 tasks): OUT-S4 (objection intelligence), OUT-A5 (appointment setter + no-fit scripts), OUT-A6 (objection handling matrix), SAL-A5 (objection library), SAL-S5 (pre-call nurture)
- **StepPanelRenderer** (6 tasks): SAL-S3 (fit call script 3-part), SAL-S6 (show-rate reminders 3-step), SAL-S7 (post-call follow-up), SAL-A4 (fit call asset 3-part), SAL-A6 (combined nurture/reminders/follow-up 4-phase), OUT-A7 (content-to-DM pipeline)

### Running totals
- Total renderers: 39/113 tasks (35%), up from 28 (25%)
- Renderer component inventory: 12 types (CategoryGrid, CandidateTable, Matrix2x2, GateChecks, ProofAudit, TransformationArc, ContentGrid, VerdictBadge, Timeline, SegmentList, MetricBar, ScopeMap, DualColumn, StepPanel)
- Remaining: 74 tasks use DefaultTaskRenderer (~40 are simple textarea-only where default is appropriate)

### Files modified
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — DualColumnRenderer, StepPanelRenderer components + 11 new TASK_RENDERERS entries
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css` — DualColumn styles (2-col grid, footer), StepPanel styles (numbered markers, vertical cards), responsive overrides

## [2026-04-13] implement | M2 — Expand BBOS custom renderer coverage (14→28 tasks)

Extended TASK_RENDERERS from 14 to 28 tasks (25% coverage, up from 12%). Created 2 new renderer components and reused 5 existing ones.

### New renderer components
- **MetricBarRenderer** — horizontal progress bars with color-coded thresholds (green ≥75%, amber ≥40%, red <40%). Used by OPT-S1 (4 canonical metrics) and OPT-A1 (5 stewardship dimensions)
- **ScopeMapRenderer** — two-column included/excluded layout with footer note. Used by OFR-A4 (Scope Map)

### Existing renderers reused for new tasks
- **VerdictBadgeRenderer** (5 new): FND-S3 (gap severity), TRU-S3 (proof strength), TRU-S6 (regulatory status), OFR-A1 (G-label promise), SAL-A0 (assembly status)
- **GateChecksRenderer** (1 new): TRU-FP02 (10-question Amanah screening rubric with ★ auto-disqualifiers using inverted polarity)
- **Matrix2x2Renderer** (3 new): OFR-A6 (guarantee 4-part structure), DLR-S2 (quality/risk quadrants), RET-S1 (4-segment client map)
- **TimelineRenderer** (2 new): DLR-S1 (delivery phases), DLR-S4 (proof capture steps)

### Files modified
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — MetricBarRenderer, ScopeMapRenderer components + 14 new TASK_RENDERERS entries
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css` — MetricBar styles (track/fill/labels), ScopeMap styles (2-col grid, tinted columns), responsive override for scope columns

### Remaining unrendered
85 tasks still use DefaultTaskRenderer. ~42 are simple textarea-only tasks where default rendering is appropriate. Priority expansion candidates: SAL stage (scripts, objection libraries), OUT stage (hook/message libraries), RET stage (message spines).

## [2026-04-13] fix | BBOS Phase 2 — design decisions + remaining high-priority fixes

Resolved 4 design decisions and implemented remaining audit fixes (H2, H3, H6, M5). H5 (sidebar link) dropped by user decision — BBOS accessible through Work projects.

### Design decisions resolved
- **D1 (H2):** Keep `STAGE_SCORE_SIGNALS` centralized config; added `fieldIds` metadata to all 50 signals + dev-time validation that cross-checks against `bbos-task-definitions.js` field IDs (runs in `import.meta.env.DEV` only)
- **D2 (H3):** WAI-ARIA Listbox pattern for BbosRolePicker — arrow keys, Enter/Space select, Escape close, Home/End, `aria-activedescendant`, focus-visible ring
- **D3 (H5):** **Dropped** — user confirmed BBOS lives in Work projects, no sidebar entry needed
- **D4 (H6):** V-prefix stays in Research Factory — clarifying comment added above `RESEARCH_PREFIXES`. V tasks gate research→asset transition; moving them would break Assembly Gate semantics
- **D5 (M5):** Panel-level + per-field + per-section error boundaries on BbosTaskPanel. New shared `ErrorBoundary` component created

### Files modified
- `src/components/shared/ErrorBoundary.jsx` — **new** reusable error boundary (class component with retry UI)
- `src/components/bbos/BbosTaskPanel.jsx` — outer ErrorBoundary wrapping export, per-field boundaries on form fields, AI Draft section boundary
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — V-prefix classification comment, `fieldIds` on all 50 STAGE_SCORE_SIGNALS entries, dev-time validation loop
- `src/components/bbos/BbosRolePicker.jsx` — full rewrite: ARIA listbox, keyboard navigation, focus styling
- `src/components/bbos/BbosRolePicker.css` — **new** extracted styles (was inline)

### Remaining open items
- M2: Only 14/113 tasks have custom renderers
- M10: 5 BBOS skill files referenced but missing from `.claude/skills/`

## [2026-04-13] audit+fix | BBOS comprehensive friction audit and critical remediation

### Audit (3 parallel explore agents)
Scanned BBOS across 3 dimensions: workflow/data integrity, UI components, and system integration. Found **42 total issues** (5 critical, 7 high, 16 medium, 14 low). Agent findings verified against source code — **3 false positives** identified and excluded:
- C1 (grid overflow): CSS Grid auto-wraps correctly — spans per row sum to 12
- C3 (AI draft non-functional): `buildPrompt()` and `parseAiResponse()` ARE implemented in `src/services/ai/`
- C4 (FND Assembly Gate): FND is research-only by design — no Asset tasks needed

### Positive findings
- 100% task/role/Islamic grounding/scoring coverage (113 tasks, 9 stages, 7 roles)
- All 9 stages have 5-signal scoring (contradicts earlier audit's "5/9 unscored" — fixed in Sprint 7)
- moveTask() completedAt fix confirmed working

### Fixes applied (8 issues)
1. **C2 — Debounce cleanup**: Added `useEffect(() => () => clearTimeout(saveTimeout.current), [])` in `BbosTaskPanel.jsx` — prevents stale store writes after panel close
2. **C5 — Atomic task seeding**: `project-store.js` `addProject()` now rolls back orphaned BBOS tasks if project persistence fails (calls `safeRemove`)
3. **H1 — useMemo optimization**: `BbosFullDashboard.jsx` selector narrowed from `s.tasksByProject` (entire map) to `s.tasksByProject[project.id]` — prevents re-computation on unrelated project changes
4. **H4 — useEffect deps**: Added `bbosFilter` to dependency array in `ProjectBoard.jsx:50` — `setActiveBbosStage` now updates when user switches stages
5. **H7 — Assembly Gate null guard**: Gate defaults to open if Done column is missing (`!doneColumnId`)
6. **M1 — Status detection fallback**: Task card status now checks both `columnId === doneColumnId` and `task.completedAt` for completion
7. **M3 — Auto-advance heuristic**: Changed from "10+ total chars across all fields" to "2+ fields with content OR 1 field with 50+ chars" — reduces false triggers
8. **L2 — ratingToStars case-insensitive**: `.toLowerCase()` applied before string matching
9. **L4 — Breakpoint fix**: `max-width: 767px` → `768px` in `BbosFullDashboard.css`
10. **L11 — Score clamping**: `renderStars()` now clamps score to `[0, max]` via `Math.min(Math.max(score, 0), max)`

### Files modified
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — H1, H7, M1, L2, L11
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css` — L4
- `src/components/bbos/BbosTaskPanel.jsx` — C2, M3
- `src/components/work/ProjectBoard.jsx` — H4
- `src/store/project-store.js` — C5

### Remaining open items (not addressed this session)
- H3: BbosRolePicker keyboard navigation (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- H5: BBOS not in sidebar navigation (discovery friction)
- H6: STR-V prefix classification (design decision needed)
- H2: STAGE_SCORE_SIGNALS hardcoded field names (refactoring scope)
- M2: Only 14/113 tasks have custom renderers
- M5: No error boundary on BbosTaskPanel
- M10: 5 BBOS skill files referenced but missing from `.claude/skills/`

## [2026-04-12] ui | AyahBanner polish + family Islamic data

**AyahBanner (TopBar verse banner) — multiple visual fixes:**
- Arabic font set to `'Amiri', serif` (matching Islamic Layer sidebar) — `AyahBanner.css`
- Source citation (`Quran X:Y`) moved from header row to below translation, centered, background removed
- "OPENING REFLECTION" label centered; `flex: 1` removed so `justify-content: center` takes effect; chevron pinned `position: absolute; right`
- Banner overlap with col-edge fixed: `left: 0` → `left: var(--edge-w, 28px)` so banner starts after the 28px column divider
- Topbar z-index raised from 10 → 16 (above col-edge at 15, below sidebar at 20); banner gets opaque surface background via `linear-gradient(--banner-tint, --banner-tint), var(--surface)` to prevent col-edge bleeding through
- Spacing between banner and page content reduced: `--space-6` (24px) → `--space-3` (12px)
- Translation `border-left` accent removed; text-align: center on both Arabic and translation

**Submodule rename — Intellect / Professional:**
- "Professional Mastery" → "Skills Mastery" → "Skill Proficiency" across 5 files: `modules.js`, `pillar-content.js`, `IntellectDashboard.jsx`, `IntellectCorePage.jsx` (INTELLECT_PILLARS array — source of truth for all Intellect level pages), `project-store.js`

**Family Islamic data bootstrapped:**
- Added `family` entry to `MODULE_ATTRS` in `src/data/islamic/islamic-data.js`
- Dua: Quran 25:74 — *Rabbanā hab lanā min azwājinā wa dhurriyyātinā…* (chosen over nikah-specific dua to serve the full Family pillar)
- Governing attrs: Al-Wadud (The Loving) + Al-Qayyum (The Self-Sustaining Sustainer)
- Closing dua: Quran 46:15 — gratitude + righteous offspring
- Full readiness check (3 rows, 3 governing, 3 not-yet) and reflection (3 governing, 3 not-yet)
- Unblocks ThresholdModal Dua tab for all family sub-modules (marriage, parenting, kinship, home)

## [2026-04-12] ui | Pillar page layout redesign — full-width tasks, centered content, segment box navigation

Redesigned the LevelNavigator and pillar/overview page layouts for visual consistency and usability.

- **Full-width task cards:** Removed `fpb-spacer` divs from `PillarLevelPage`; task cards now span the full content area
- **Centered layout:** `max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto` on `fpb-layout` and `flo__grid` for wide-viewport centering
- **Consistent spacing:** Added `padding: var(--space-6)` to PillarLevelPage outer container — verse-banner → navigator gap is now 49px on both overview and pillar pages
- **Segment column boxes:** Each pillar column is a rounded box; active column fills with `--seg-color`; clicking the box navigates to the pillar page
- **New shared components:** `src/pages/shared/` (LevelOverviewPage, PillarLevelPage) and `src/components/shared/` (LevelNavigator)
- **Commit:** `b172e5a` → `onaxyzogden/Maqasid` main

## [2026-04-12] implement | Dashboard refresh — LevelNavigator design language

Rewrote the main dashboard (`/app`) using the Faith module's `LevelNavigator` as the visual reference.

**Changes delivered:**
- **`PillarProgressStrip`** (new component, `src/components/dashboard/PillarProgressStrip.jsx`): 7-column horizontal bar strip, one column per Maqasid pillar. Each bar is subdivided proportionally into done (--col-done green) / in-progress (--col-review amber) / todo (--bg3 gray) segments based on real task data. Pillar accent border-top, Arabic root label in Islamic mode, links to `/app/pillar/:pillarId`.
- **Maqasid Focus panel**: Replaced the "coming soon" placeholder inside `.insight-recommendations` with a live panel listing pillars ranked by open task count (overdue first), with accent-colored left bar, open-task count chip, and Arabic root.
- **Stat cards** trimmed from 4 to 2: In Progress + Overdue. Value font size bumped to 1.8rem.
- **EPH metric** renamed → "Today / tasks completed".
- **Section labels** added: "MAQASID AL-SHARI'AH" (above strip) and "OVERVIEW" (above bottom row).
- **CSS polish**: gap var(--space-6), WF bar height 14px, bottom-row columns 1fr 1.4fr, Space Grotesk labels.

**Bugs found and fixed during session:**
1. PillarProgressStrip was using `useThresholdStore.completedOpening` (ceremony state) to color segments green — not task completion. Rewrote to use `useProjectStore` + `useTaskStore` with project ID prefix resolution (`project.id.startsWith(pillar.id + '_')` as primary, `subModuleIds.includes(project.moduleId)` as fallback).
2. Maqasid Focus `pillarSummary` useMemo used only `subModuleIds.includes(p.moduleId)` — broke for all pillars whose project moduleIds don't match subModuleIds verbatim (faith: 'shahada' vs 'faith-shahada'). Applied same prefix-based fix.

**Key architectural note:** Project ID prefix pattern (`{pillarId}_{submodule}_{level}`) is the reliable pillar resolver. `subModuleIds` fallback covers generic modules (wealth, ummah). Neither `useModulesProgress` hook nor raw `subModuleIds` matching alone is sufficient for faith/life/intellect/family/environment.

## [2026-04-11] graphify | Knowledge graph regeneration (post-audit)

Regenerated graphify knowledge graph after completing all 35 audit findings across 8 sprints.

- **Scope:** `src/ + wiki/ + docs/ + tasks/` (314 files, ~295K words)
- **Graph:** 1,012 nodes, 1,517 edges, 8 hyperedges, 126 communities (25 labeled)
- **Token reduction:** 79.7% (383K raw → 78K graph tokens)
- **God nodes:** threshold-store (93 edges, bridges 9 communities), project-store (79), contacts-store (49), task-store (34), settings-store (27)
- **Key insight:** threshold-store centrality is intentional (Islamic ceremony gating is cross-cutting), but 63/93 edges are per-page imports that could be lifted to a single router-level `<CeremonyGuard>` wrapper
- **Outputs:** `graphify-out/graph.html`, `graphify-out/graph.json`, `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`
- Updated `wiki/entities/maqasid-os.md` with new graph stats; resolved open question on graph regeneration

## [2026-04-11] implement | Sprint 8 — Documentation & Git Hygiene (#26, #27, #28, #31)

Final sprint of the 35-finding technical audit remediation.

- **#26 CONTEXT.md freshness:** Updated 4 stale files (bbos, work, tech, shared) with current file inventories after Sprint 4-7 additions
- **#27 Wiki entities:** Synced maqasid-os.md and bbos-pipeline.md with Sprint 4-7 history; resolved 3 open questions on bbos-pipeline (Two-Factory UI, G-Label descriptions, Assembly Gate)
- **#28 Lessons learned:** Populated `tasks/lessons.md` with 7 patterns from the remediation (mock data, sessionStorage, quota estimation, pruning, dual stores, CONTEXT.md co-maintenance, false-positive verification)
- **#31 Bundle size ADR:** Created `wiki/decisions/2026-04-11-bundle-size-2mb.md` — accept 2 MB monolithic bundle, revisit at 3 MB or multi-user. Indexed dual-contact-stores ADR from Sprint 5.

**All 35 findings now addressed across 8 sprints.** Branch: `docs/freshness-update`.

## [2026-04-11] audit | Comprehensive 8-submodule system audit

### Scope
Read-only audit across 8 submodules: Build & Lint, BBOS Pipeline Workflow, Dashboard & Navigation, Islamic UI Layer, Store & Persistence, Operational Modules (People/Money/CRM/Office/Tech), Documentation Freshness, Git Hygiene.

### Key findings (35 total: 5 Critical, 12 High, 13 Medium, 5 Low)

**Critical:**
- Rules-of-Hooks violations in ProjectBoard.jsx:87, DashboardView.jsx:17/19, IslamicTerm.jsx:24/36 (conditional hooks)
- safeSet() silently swallows localStorage quota errors — user loses data without notification
- moveTask() resets completedAt to null — tasks appear incomplete in Done column
- BBOS task seeding not atomic — tasks can vanish on reload if second persist fails
- Import (Settings.jsx) has no schema validation or backup — can corrupt entire database

**High:**
- 82 unused vars, 4 impure renders (Date.now in useState/useMemo), 28 exhaustive-deps warnings
- BBOS: auto-advance too permissive, no role filtering in dashboard, 5/9 stages unscored
- Dashboard: no onboarding empty state, pillar dashboards show "Coming Soon"
- Islamic: missing closingDua for People/Wealth pillars, NiyyahAct Skip=Confirm
- Modules: Money dashboard uses mock data, Tech monitoring simulated but unlabeled
- ESLint scans .obsidian/, atlas/, graphify-out/ unnecessarily

**Documentation staleness:**
- 6 CONTEXT.md files stale (work, shared, bbos missing new components)
- Wiki entity pages don't reflect Apr 11 features
- tasks/lessons.md empty despite rapid development

### Files referenced
- Plan: `.claude/plans/bubbly-watching-locket.md`
- Full audit output: conversation log (not persisted to file)

## [2026-04-11] implement | UI polish + unified DashboardTaskCard + BBOS cleanup

- Created `src/components/shared/DashboardTaskCard.jsx` + `.css` — unified card replacing PillarTaskCard and BBOS TaskCard. Whole card clickable; dynamic rendering of subtasks, field progress, due dates, tags, purpose, and custom BBOS renderers via children prop. ~5.4 KB CSS reduction.
- Converted all dashboard audit systems from 5-star to 3-star (BbosFullDashboard, DashboardView, PillarLevelDashboard). Scoring thresholds and verdict logic adjusted for 3-point scale.
- CSS consistency pass: card padding 22px → 20px, star gap 1px → 2px, empty star opacity 0.25 → 0.2 in BbosFullDashboard.css.
- Removed empty card message (`getEmptyMessage`) from BBOS task cards — status communicated via chips and progress bar.
- Removed FND-IFB-S1 through FND-IFB-S5 ("IFB Forms" group) from `bbos-task-definitions.js` and `bbos-role-access.js` — backend admin tasks not operator-facing.
- Tasks page (`/work/:id/tasks`) generic dashboard updated to 3-star audit.

## [2026-04-09] bootstrap | Wiki initialization
- Created wiki directory structure and SCHEMA.md
- Seeded 5 entity pages, 4 concept pages, 3 decision pages, 3 source summaries
- Built initial index.md
- Migrated from NotebookLM-based orientation to wiki-based orientation

## [2026-04-09] implement | Edge column polish + file upload testing
- Polished edge column hover/focus-visible/active states in AppShell.css (primary-bg pattern)
- Boosted dark theme edge line contrast (--border → --border2 override)
- Fixed double `bbiz_` prefix bug in PillarResourcesTab storage key
- Added migration shim for any pre-existing double-prefixed resource data
- E2E tested file upload: txt, pdf, mp3, oversized rejection, link mode, dark theme cards
- Wrote IndexedDB migration design doc (`stages/design-indexeddb-resource-storage-draft.md`)

## [2026-04-11] implement | TRU dynamic scoring + Family Office module

### TRU-AF5 Integrity Threshold — dynamic calculation
- Replaced static `overallProofStrength` lookup with a weighted 5-signal score in `TruDashboard.jsx`
- Signals: TRU-S3.overallProofStrength (max 5) + TRU-V1 gates A/B/C/D (max 5 each) = max 25 pts
- Formula: `Math.round((rawScore / 25) * 100)`
- Verdict thresholds: ≥75% QUALIFIED, ≥50% DEVELOPING, ≥25% REVIEW NEEDED, <25% BLOCKED
- Empty fields score 0 (denominator stays 25)

### TRU-AF5 Audited Claim Strength — dynamic
- Replaced binary pass/fail stars with graduated gate scoring: pass=5★, conditional=3★, fail=1★, empty=0★
- Sub-labels now dynamic: pass → domain label, conditional → "Conditional", fail → "Gate Failed", empty → "Not Assessed"

### Family Office module
- Added Office module to Family section — two access points:
  1. Tab in `FamilyPage.jsx` (`/app/family`) via `mainTab` state + `<Office embedded />`
  2. Dedicated sidebar entry at `/app/family-office` listed under FAMILY after Home Environment
- Files: `FamilyPage.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `maqasid.js` (subModuleIds), `modules.js` (entry), `Sidebar.jsx` (route map)

## [2026-04-11] implement | StageScoreCard — dynamic scoring extended to STR, OFR, OUT

### StageScoreCard component (BbosFullDashboard.jsx)
- Added `StageScoreCard` component rendered above `ProjectAuditCard` for stages with signal definitions
- Reads field values from `taskMap` across multiple tasks, computes weighted score (5 signals × 5 pts = 25 max)
- Verdicts: ≥75% QUALIFIED, ≥50% DEVELOPING, ≥25% REVIEW NEEDED, <25% BLOCKED
- Renders null for stages without signal definitions (FND, SAL, DLR, RET, OPT — unaffected)

### STAGE_SCORE_SIGNALS config
- TRU (5 signals): TRU-S3.overallProofStrength + TRU-V1 gates A/B/C/D — **restores scoring lost when TruDashboard.jsx was deleted**
- STR (5 signals): integrityVerdict, verbatimPhrases line count, contentAngle1-6 filled count, beliefStatement filled, transformation arc fields filled
- OFR (5 signals): promiseGLabel (G1/G2), ICP 4-field completeness, guarantee 4-field completeness, scope map (included+excluded), proofStatus
- OUT (5 signals): icOut1–icOut5 from OUT-IC integrity checks (binary pass=5/fail=0)

### ProofAuditRenderer upgrade (TRU-AF5)
- Claim strength ratings now render as graduated stars via `ratingToStars()`: Strong=5★, Moderate=3★, Weak=2★, Unverifiable/Insufficient=1★
- Unknown rating strings fall back to plain text display

### Helpers hoisted
- `renderStars` moved from inside ProjectAuditCard to module scope (reused by StageScoreCard + ProofAuditRenderer)
- `ratingToStars` helper added

### Files modified
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — STAGE_SCORE_SIGNALS config, StageScoreCard component, ProofAuditRenderer upgrade, renderStars hoist
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css` — `.bfd__ssc-*` styles, `.bfd__audit-rating` flex update, `.bfd__audit-rating-label`, responsive overrides

## [2026-04-11] implement | BbosFullDashboard bento refinements + G-label panel fix

### Bento grid layout
- Switched `.bfd__grid` from `repeat(3, 1fr)` to `repeat(12, 1fr)` 12-column grid
- Replaced `getCardSpan(prefix, indexInGroup)` with `computeGroupSpans(prefix, defs)` — processes defs in pairs, assigns wider span (7) to the task with the longer label, narrower span (5) to the shorter; solo cards at end of odd-count groups span 12; IC prefix always spans 12

### Contextual empty states
- Added `TASK_EMPTY_OVERRIDES` map for all 16 custom-rendered tasks (hand-crafted messages, e.g. "Complete STR-AF1 to populate the core belief statement")
- Added `getEmptyMessage(def)` fallback that derives message from `def.purpose` first sentence for the remaining ~102 tasks
- Purpose line now only shown when card `hasData`; empty cards show only the contextual message

### ProjectAuditCard restored
- Added `ProjectAuditCard` component inside `BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — full-width card at grid bottom
- Computes 4 audit checks (Task Coverage, Completion Rate, Scheduling Discipline, Subtask Depth) scoped to current stage tasks
- STRONG / QUALIFIED / DEVELOPING / NEEDS WORK verdict + health threshold percentage
- Left panel: verdict box; right panel: 2-column star-rated metrics grid

### Completion status backgrounds
- Added `status` computation in `TaskCard`: `empty` / `active` (has data, no completedAt) / `complete` (has completedAt)
- Applied as BEM modifier `bfd__card--${status}` with CSS color-mix tints
- `--active`: faint primary tint + border; `--complete`: faint green tint + border; `--empty`: neutral

### G-Label picker fix
- `BbosTaskPanel.jsx`: gated `GLabelPicker` / Integrity Label row behind `def.hasGLabel`
- Previously rendered unconditionally for all BBOS tasks regardless of flag
- Now only visible on tasks where `hasGLabel: true` (all AF tasks in STR, selected IFB/TRU tasks)

### Files modified
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — computeGroupSpans, getEmptyMessage, TASK_EMPTY_OVERRIDES, ProjectAuditCard, status backgrounds
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css` — 12-col grid, status modifier classes, ProjectAuditCard styles
- `src/components/bbos/BbosTaskPanel.jsx` — def.hasGLabel gate on GLabelPicker

## [2026-04-11] implement | Task card color coding + stage tab status + auto-advance

### Task card status color fix
- Fixed `--active` CSS color: was `var(--primary)` (#4ab8a8 teal → appeared green), changed to `var(--pri-high)` (#f59e0b amber)
- Fixed status detection: was using `task.completedAt` (always null — `moveTask()` resets it explicitly); changed to `task.columnId === doneColumnId`
- `doneColumnId` derived from `project.columns.find(c => c.name === 'Done')?.id` inside `useMemo` in `BbosFullDashboard.jsx`
- Card status now correctly tracks the Kanban column (To Do → neutral, In Progress → amber, Done → green)

### Stage tab color coding (BbosPipelineHeader)
- Added `stageStatusMap` computed in `ProjectBoard.jsx` via `useMemo` — maps each stage ID to `'empty' | 'active' | 'complete'`
- Logic: tasks grouped by stage prefix (`t.bbosTaskType.split('-')[0]`); active = has non-empty `bbosFieldData`; complete = all tasks in Done column
- `stageStatusMap` passed as prop to `BbosPipelineHeader`; applied as `bbos-stage-node--status-${status}` BEM modifier
- CSS: `--status-active` (amber tint) and `--status-complete` (green tint) placed before `--filtered` / `--current` in cascade — filtered/current states always override

### Auto-advance to In Progress
- Added `advanceToInProgress()` helper in `BbosTaskPanel.jsx`: finds "To Do" and "In Progress" columns, calls `moveTask` only if task is currently in "To Do"
- Called in 3 places: (1) `handleFieldChange` — after 300ms debounce, for non-internal non-empty field values; (2) after AI draft field population; (3) after template import
- Does not move tasks backward — condition guards on `task.columnId === toDoCol?.id`

### Files modified
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.jsx` — doneColumnId in useMemo, TaskCard status fix, amber --active
- `src/components/bbos/BbosFullDashboard.css` — `.bfd__card--active` changed to `--pri-high`
- `src/components/work/ProjectBoard.jsx` — stageStatusMap useMemo, stageStatusMap prop on BbosPipelineHeader
- `src/components/bbos/BbosPipelineHeader.jsx` — stageStatusMap prop, status class on each stage node
- `src/components/bbos/BbosPipelineHeader.css` — `.bbos-stage-node--status-active/complete` styles
- `src/components/bbos/BbosTaskPanel.jsx` — advanceToInProgress helper, called from handleFieldChange + AI draft + template import

## [2026-04-09] ingest | NotebookLM migration (Phase 5)
- Queried 3 NotebookLM notebooks: BBOS (84220e85), Maqasid (053ac9ef), Clief Notes (7eb920ab)
- Updated [[bbos-pipeline]] with v2.4 architecture, Two-Factory Model, 7 non-negotiable business rules
- Updated [[maqasid-al-shariah]] with Auda's 6 systems features, ethical screening framework
- Created [[claude-os]] entity page — MWP 3-layer system, 60/30/10 framework, session patterns
- Created [[source-notebooklm-migration]] source summary
- Updated 2 pages, created 2 new pages
- NotebookLM registry marked as legacy — wiki is now authoritative context source

## [2026-04-15] feat+fix | Readiness check card wizard + subtask stage progress

### Readiness check redesign
- Replaced interactive readiness check (all rows visible, small yes/not-yet buttons) with card-based wizard
- One row per page: two side-by-side cards (green=yes, beige=not-yet) with checkmark selection
- Internal Next/Previous navigation, progress counter ("X/Y rows completed")
- Mobile responsive: cards stack vertically at <=480px
- Display-only mode (IslamicPanel sidebar) unchanged
- Files: `src/components/islamic/ReadinessCheck.jsx`, `ReadinessCheck.css`

### Subtask stage progress fix
- BBOS `pillarProgress` now includes fractional credit from subtask completion
- Previously: task with 2/4 subtasks done = 0%. Now: = 50% of that task's weight
- Aligned with `useModuleProgress` hook's `taskWeight()` pattern
- File: `src/components/work/ProjectBoard.jsx` (lines 98-118)

### Commit
- `df242af` — pushed to main

## [2026-04-16] feat(seed-data) | Standardize subtask descriptions with Why/How format

### What was done
- Standardized all subtask descriptions in faith-seed-tasks.js (212 subtasks) and life-seed-tasks.js (236 subtasks) to follow a two-section format:
  - **"Why does this matter?"** — 1-3 sentences grounding the subtask in Islamic significance or practical importance
  - **"How do I accomplish this?"** — actionable steps, details, and verification criteria
- Faith file: reorganized existing unstructured descriptions into the new format
- Life file: created 236 new description fields from scratch (previously had none)
- Sources remain in the separate `sources` field, rendered via the Source(s) button
- Normalized 3 legacy "Why This Matters:" headers to "Why does this matter?"

### Execution approach
- Chunked work into parallel subagents by section (5 batches for faith, 4 for life)
- Each agent handled ~40-60 subtasks within a specific pillar submodule range
- Total: 448 subtask descriptions processed

### Remaining
- Intellect, Family, Wealth, Environment seed files still have subtasks with no descriptions
- Recommended: process in future sessions using the same chunked-agent approach

### Commit
- `fe0a5a9` — pushed to main
